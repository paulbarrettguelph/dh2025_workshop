My Dear friend
I am just going to proceed in the stage for New York. However, I must endeavor first to give you some account of my journey this far, through a country which was once the seat of your ancestors; but that is now covered with European settlements, whose persevering industry has greatly changed the face of the country; and forests continue to disappear before the efforts of the laborious woodman. Is there any thing in their change to call for the sensations of sorrow in the breast of the philanthropic patriot? if there is, it is not because the inanimate clod has changed possessors, or that, what was once an unculti-vated waste, is now covered with human habitations, and rendered abundant in productions for the sustenance and comfort of man; but it is because we have not been sufficiently benefited by the example of that which is worthy and commendable in the character of good Europeans and have been greatly contaminated to the contrary - Had the Chiefs, who relinquished this country, acquired more vir-tuous knowledge from their enlightened neighbours, they might have obtained such compensation and retained such reserves which properly disposed of after the settle-ment of the country, when the value of land had raised; might have enabled them to have established a fund for the support and promotion of industrious in our present territory
 [scribbled out lines]
But to return to my journey Ð I left Niagara and parted with my friends with I know not what mixed impressions of joy and grief Ð which seemed to urge me with greater expedition to proceed &amp; rendered it exceeding unpleasant for me to make any delay. However as agree-ably as the situation of my mind would allow of, I passed one day at Canandarque (sp. Canadaque) mostly in the company of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Morris &amp; Mr. Greig, a gentleman from Scotland, who had always honored</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="12">
        <p>me with every hospitable and polite attention whenever business called me to these parts. My friend Ihaskoghsage was not at home, but I obtained of that which was due a sufficiency to enable me to attempt my voyage from the gentleman who manages his affairs. 
At the Inn where I stop a Man put up who told me he was going the way I proposed to go and that I might obtain a passage in his sleigh. When he had satisfied me, that he would be expeditious, and that I might depend upon the goodness of his horses, I agreed to go with him. In consequence of changing my mode of travelling from foot to going in a carriage a young lady from our parts then at Canandarque (sp. Canadaque) with a brother, whom I knew proposed going under my protection, to Icohare where she had another brother. But unfortunately we were both deceived in the capability of the horses that drew us and shortly after our departure it now ap-peared clear, that unless we obtained others, we should be sure of a tedious journey. Had I been alone I would have easily remedied this inconvenience by going on foot; but as the Lady had come under my protection I could not with propriety leave her until we reached her brothers. I endeavored to hire a sleigh, but none was to be had; so we were constrained to remain with the old man and his sorry nags. The first day we slept at about six miles East of Cayuga, and the next day at Ikanyadares, about eighteen miles farther. The snow had fallen very deep, which so increased the difficulty of travelling, that our man with his sleigh could hardly be prevailed on to start again, and all attempts to obtain another sleigh and horses were fruitless. I am apprehend-sive, that contrary to my inclination, my looks betrayed the anxiety of my mind at being detained by the tardiness of our conveyance. The lady observed she had a brother in law about twenty six miles farther, and that if she could get that far, she would tarry until the roads became better Ð we set off again, but had not proceeded above five miles when our man expressed his determination of not going any farther. Not finding any horses to hire at the house where we stopped (sp. stopt), I was on my way to the next house to inquire if any might be had there, when I perceived</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="13">
        <p>that a sleigh with two men in it had just passed. I ran after it, aim on overtaking them, petitioned very earnestly, that they would admit the lady, either for payment or friendship (for on looking at them I was dubious if they were not above hire) - as for myself I could keep up on foot. They agreed, and with joy I went to the house for her; and the horses being of the best, we made expedition. I found at Onondaga valley that the gentlemen were brothers, that they were of the first at Whitestown (sp. WhiteÕs town), and that they had been to Ikanyadares for a peculiar kind of trout to introduce into ponds, which they had formed on their plantations.Ê
At Manlius we left our female companion with her relations; &amp; indeed I was left also. For being at tea with a party of ladies (who had accidentally met there) while our companions were looking after their horses and fish, I had got so engaged in conversation, that when notice was sent that they were ready I did not im-mediately receive it, &amp; they set off without me. As I found they had taken with them my portmanteau, I followed with all speed, and overtook them a little to the west of the descent to Kaneghsorage. I then entered the sleigh, &amp; was very warm, although the evening was of the coldest; but on coming to the top of the hill that overlooks the Oneida Lake, the keen North East wind seemed to strike through me, and it is there I think originated a cold which almost tends to indisposition so much does it affect me.Ê
At Kaneghsorage we slept at a tavern kept by John Denny a kind of Mohawk, whose father had been on the American side in the war; he has a fine large brick house, and is as earnest to gain money as anybody. This village, as you know? consists of a kind of mixture of Mohawks, Oneidas and old French prisoners taken in the French War. 
Next morning early we passed (sp. past) through Oneida; and as I had seen enough of it already we did not stop there, but went on to the next tavern. That this village, as well as the aforemention-ed are immersed in the greatest corruption of drunkenness and debauchery is indeed a melancholy fact. We may</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="14">
        <p>suppose, as the principal causes of their immorality and disorder, an utter want of education (although they are nominally Christians) - too great indulgence shown them during the various wars - to prevent their going to the opposite side - and lastly, since the settlements established in their neighborhood, the too easy acquisition of spirituous liquors which has certainly not a little contributed to the promotion of Evil. Let us leave this disagreeable picture of our degraded brethren and hope that one day the Great Spirit may use his power to reclaim them, and preserve our other Brethren from ever knowing the misfortune of becoming equally vicious.Ê
We arrived at the house of the youngest brother; it was a real farmhouse with all necessary appendages [scribbled out lines] - the Eldest proceeded with me to his house, which was an elegant building and his lady to whom he introduced me was beau-tiful, lively, and young. This gentlemanÕs plantation was decorated with great taste; poplars &amp; willows orna-mented the various fences &amp; a fish pond enlivened a beautiful lawn near the house. He very kindly entreated me to pass the afternoon and night with him; which I readily would have complied with, had I not been appre-hensive of losing a passage in the stage from Utica the next morning. He accompanied me a mile on the way: when we parted with the feeling of friends just entering on the path of friendship together. He returned home and I proceeded on the road towards Utica through the settlement of Whites-town (sp. WhiteÕs town): The former we call Fihaghgwetsne; and the latter which extends on both sides of the stream that we call Oriska (sp. Orheska) near which Gen. Herkimer was defeated last war, by our warriors: It is amazing to see the rapid progress this settle-ment has made since the conclusion of the war, which does not much exceed twenty years. It now surpasses many of the</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="15">
        <p>Eastern settlements in elegance of buildings and opulence; and of this superiority the natural fertility of the soil and industry of the settlers have been the cause. For among this people there are few or no idlers. Those who possess money or other property which they or their ancestors may have accumulated, although they seem to be at leisure, and to live at their ease, yet they or those they employ are the persons who principally con-tribute to keep the wheel in motion. They make contracts for the produce of the country, which they purchase of the farmers with the merchandize they have imported for their use. These for the most part are not able to wait the time necessary for the returns of their produce, nor could they spare the time necessary to form distant connections for taking off what they individually raise: so that the enterprising merchant is to the farmers, a great convenience, at the same time, that they are the various channels through which wealth is added to his funds. A settler that is known to an able merchant, to be a steady industrious man, can obtain credit to aid him in commencing his improvements; perhaps goods wherewith to pay his wood choppers, and the ashes, when made into pearl ash, will sometimes pay for the clearing of the woods and boiling the materials. From the observations I have made, my dear friend, it appears evident that they exceed us more in their systematic &amp; regular management, than they do in a su-perior capability for labor. There are many of the most dextrous at handling the axe or at other manual labor, who are notwithstanding always poor for want of judgement in using their talents. There are others who though they have never been brought up to labor any more than ourselves, yet by making a good use of what they are capable of Ð find means to make small improvements; and the produce of these soon enables them to extend them further by the labor of others.
As we are poor and stand in need of many things, would it not be advisable for us to imitate them at least as far as we are capable, and as far as may be consistent with sentiments of piety and virtue? for I would not change our poverty to be swallowed up in the vortex of avarice; but I am con-vinced poverty is not a safeguard against this vice.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="16">
        <p>We may observe daily, without going from home, that those who have least disposition to acquire by active exertion are generally the most greedy to obtain by other means even although they should not be the most honorable. Active industry appears rather to be an antidote to avarice and an incitement to generosity. The successful hunter has for the most part been found generous; and why, might we not hope, should we become herdsmen, or farmers (for we cannot expect to be able to reanimate the bones of the departed inhabitants of our forests) that he, who has had success with his flock or his crop, would also be generous of that which the bountiful hand of nature had bestowed on him, as a reward for his labor and his care. There [DR2]is besides a further satisfaction in this kind of employment, that success in it depends more on our own conduct than it does in that of the hunter. 
I apprehend my Dear friend, that there is hardly any si-tuation more exposed to the baneful vices of covetousness, and envy than that of our particular Five Tribes. Situate, as they are, in the neighborhood of and among European settlements, their wants to become greater than their industry can supply; for the hunter, however fortunate he may be, cannot at present obtain sufficient peltries to purchase wherewithal to cloth a family amply. Our farming supplies little more than sufficient for our own consumption. What remains consists of the pitiful annuities at two or three dollars per man. Then the bounty of our Father the King is a great support to such as are in favor with the Superintendent; but I fear that in order to enjoy this favor, some are tempted to be mean. To pursue industrious employment with judgement would be much better than all those. For instance, twenty dollars wherewith you may buy a cow and, with care, may every year raise a calf, will be of more service to your family for the present time than three dollars annuity; besides, that at the end of ten years, you may have a considerable stock of cattle. 
Indeed there is nothing to prevent us in some degree from imitating the Industry of Europeans, but the want of Will you will say, they are rich, and we are poor; but riches are of no utility in this respect, but as they command the labor of many, and direct their joined efforts to</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="17">
        <p>a general point. By union a number of men may perform the same labor which a single rich man does by means of his money. In war it has been the custom for our warriors to unite firmly together to support the honor of our tribes and to destroy the human species. In peace can we not as well unite our joint efforts for the preservation and increase of our species, by rendering them comfortable in the abundant supply of all their natural wants? You will yet observe that we are in want of the necessary implements and utensils for carrying on work extensively: this is very true; but when difficulties occur in a laudable attempt, we must not for that season desist, but rather endeavor to remedy them as well as we can. For instance, could we prevail on the people to be content for one year with two dollars instead of three in the division of the annuities, this might contribute considerably towards the furnishing these athidy: and as sometimes a warrior who has been obliged to go to war without any other weapon but a spear becomes possessed of a gun from some of his conquered enemies; so if you persevere like men, finally the fruits of your labors will furnish all that is wanted. 
I arrive in Utica at dusk, and find that the stage leaves it at daybreak. Next day I enter it in company with a single gentleman in black; we have a very silent ride, the great fall of snow causing us to go on very slowly and ar-rive in the evening at the Stone Church. The Inn where we put up was formerly the house of our old friend Major Nellis: the present landlord retains a strong remembrance of last war; and perhaps on that account, and the dress I was in did not give me that reception which it was his duty to do, a circumstance which caused me to be the more particular.

        <p>[scribbled out lines] In the morning we again embarked, there were now two additional gentlemen in company. One of these gentlemen being of a social communicative temper we became very well acquainted before we reached Schenectady where we dined, and arrived about ten oÕ clock last night at this place. I put up with one of my companions at the city tavern, where we find Lord Selkirk a very respectable Scotch nobleman who has had allotted to him in the western half of Canada a tract of land to be settled by people from Scotland, whom an over-crowded population compels to emigrate; and, as I have heard before I left you, His Lordship benevolently gives them his aid to bring them over &amp; enable them to establish them-selves there; This nobleman is exceedingly pleasant, affable, &amp; intelligent I had the pleasure of a considerable conver-sation with him probably from his desire of being made acquainted with the manners &amp; customs of our people and their connections. I have seen several of the great men here but had not time to see the Governor. I had proposed stopping within this evening, it being wet and disagreeable out; but I find Mr. R sends to let me know that supper is ready so I must set off. Ð Adieu my dear friend</p>

        <p>Hudson, March 10, 1804
My Dear friend
I left you last in order to go to supper with Mr. R. His hospitality &amp; friendly conversation delayed me to a late hour, so that I did not return to the hotel, but slept at his house that night. Indeed he had partly prevailed on me to pass the evening at Albany; which I certainly should have done, had not the lad from the stage-house called for me at day-break, which determined me to persevere in my first resolution of losing no time; so I immediately arose, returned to the hotel, got ready, and went to the stage house. Finding that the stage was gone; I ran and overtook it, at the distance of about half a mile. I there found the passengers embarked in two sleighs instead of the usual vehicle; which you know is a long carriage. This latter could not travel with facility in the situation the roads then were in, from the great fall of snow that had recently taken place, and which was now melting by a thaw and a drizzling rain.
There were three of us in each carriage. We proceeded for the first few miles without any other mark of sociality (as indeed, is generally the case, when people, of different appear-ances, and strangers to each other, are thus stowed up together in a public conveyance) than that which every decent man will observe of not willingly incommoding (sp. incomoding) his neighbor by wantonly kicking his shins or trampling on his toes or taking offence at not being known by intuition. One of my companions, however, at the first place where we stopped, ob-served, that he conjectured, I was from the Grand River, from my leggins being of deer skin leather; I answered in the affirmative, and that I also must imagine him to be from Canada, from the observation he had made; &amp; I found that he was from the Eastern part of that province.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="20">
        <p>Near Kinderhook we perceived a sleigh coming towards us from the quarter to which we were going. On its approach, the atten-tion of this gentleman was particularly taken up, in observing one of the passengers who came in it. When we met, and they were making way for us to pass, he suddenly jumped out of our sleigh and collared the person at whom before he had looked so earnestly. By the altercation that took place we could understand, that our friend seized this man for a fraud, which although in the literal sense it was not a robbery, yet, all things considered, had in it a greater degree of criminality: for the offender had equally in effect deprived another person of his property; and in further aggravation, had betrayed a confidence placed in him. Yet from the instability &amp; imperfection of man, the laws are wise in being more lenient to him, who defrauds; than to him who robs: because of the former crime a man may be accused unjustly, with greater facility than he can of the latter.
Our companion bade us farewell, and returned with his captive. We arrived at Kinderhook: where we changed horses and carriages, a gentleman in a Quaker habit, who had been in the other sleigh, came into that which I was in, &amp; we left the other two gentlemen to overtake us; for the landlord could neither furnish the horses requisite with the desired expedition, nor be civil to the disappointed passengers: so that they were thus constrained to hire a sleigh of the neighbors.
We soon entered into conversation on the oddity of the occurrence on the road, that had not a little tickled us, (that is when we did not reflect on the proceeding guilt and resulting distress of a fellow creature). From this we proceeded to other subjects, particularly the pernicious effect that immoral &amp; impious writings</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="21">
        <p>have on the weak &amp; uninformed understanding; and how necessary it was to be careful with those who learnt to read, in giving a proper direction to that qualification, and keeping out of their way every book of a vicious tendency, at least until the judgement might be sufficiently ripened to enable them to cull the good and reject the Evil. But alas in many, this is never the case: and surely it could not be with propriety termed an infringement on the liberty of the press, to curb its licentiousness, whenever &amp; wherever it might appear; for none should have the liberty to gratify so diabolical a desire, as that of corrupting their fellow creatures.  
We arrived at Hudson at about three oÕclock, and had dinner there; at the conclusion of which Mr. W- came in, with whom I had a little business, which de-tained me at that place, rather against my inclination, after the acquaintance, I had formed with my worthy friend: for I could perceive our hearts commenced to warm with mutual friendship; his benevolent &amp; venerable look showed that he was the friend of man. I was almost de-termined to throw aside business for pleasure; (which in-deed I might as well have done) had not the impor-tunity of Mr. W- detained me.
This town has arisen since the conclusion of the war and has now the appearance of a considerable trade, which must show itself more conspicuously in the summer season, when the river is open; for at present it is frozen: the neighboring country is well inhabited &amp; the families of long standing are principally Dutch.

My Dear friend</p>

        <p>New York, March 16, 1804
My Dear friend, 
I was detained two days at Hudson, but in the course of that time could not learn or see much more than that their farms mills do seem to be more neat, and more completely finished than in the new settlements in our neighborhood. The reason appears to be that the po-pulation being more abundant, labor is with greater ease obtained; and a ready market for all produce turns every improvement to the im-mediate advantage of the possessor. 
I left it in the afternoon of the 12th and arrived here by the stage yesterday forenoon. The roads being so bad caused us to be nearly a day longer on our journey than we should other-wise have been. I did not meet with much worth describing to you on this rout, the season preventing me from discovering the real face of the country, when in its beauty; and to give you an account of the various inns we stopped at, would be perhaps, as tedious to you, as it was to me when travelling wet, and cold over a bad road. Suffice it to say that they were al civilly conducted &amp; my wants being few were readily gratified for money Ð My fellow passengers were mostly Captains of Albany troops, at least I was informed so; they talked a great lot, although not much to the purpose. There was, however a gentleman, who had been many years a Captain on the Atlantic, as also in the Pacific, and who had lately retired to the interior to live a country life. Though sufficiently affable, he said very little, unless when particularly asked a question; yet I learnt from him, that in some parts of New England (of which he was a native) on the sea coast, where the soil was naturally barren &amp; unpro-ductive, the inhabitants had become opulent (sp. oppulent) through their industry in the fishery industry my dear friend is never without a resource. In whatever situation man may be placed, let him only make a good use of his time, and generally he may pass the journey of life without difficulty as to its necessaries.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="23">
        <p>This gentleman seemed to have too great an aversion to the Spaniards, for to gain much correct information from him of those who inhabit South America, he gave a good character of the aboriginal natives, as a simple inoffen-sive people. A young gentleman who had been in France seemed so in raptures with that nation, that as he described them you would have thought the country a paradise, the men all heroes and the women all angels; we must never rely on the descriptions of these partial people, unless well proved by facts, for they are more the produc-tions of their passions, than of cool observation. 
Immediately on arriving I called on Mr. L-n son in law to A_s Phi_ps Esqr: I found his father in law was not yet arrived as I expected Ð but this gentleman was ready to answer every demand Ð and after dinner we went to inquire for the first vessel going to Britain Ð we found one going to sail in a day or two, and I immediately took my passage in a ship for Liverpool, congratulating myself at not having made much unnecessary delay on my journey, as I now flattered myself with the probability of arriving time enough in Europe, to partake in any campaign, that might be undertaken in the Spring. This being done I hastened to call on my worthy E_d P_s (Edmund Parsons) as he had requested me to do, I was eager to undeceive him in a point, which I had not an opportunity to do sooner Ð in the stage he asked me where I was going, I answered to the Southward not think-ing it prudent to make it too public, that I was going to England in time of war, this was true in a literal (sp. litteral) sense; but he understood it as if I had been going to Congress or the Southern States Ð he received me very cordially and introduced me to Mrs. P-s on whose coun-tenance is strongly marked the piety, virtue &amp; good sense, that decorate her mind, the kindness of this venerable gentleman much surpassed anything I could have expected from so short an acquaintance; on informing him exactly of my real rout &amp; reason for not having done it sooner; he ob-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="24">
        <p>served, that he had intended to give me letters to his friends in the Southward but as it was, that I went to England, he had friends also there to whom he would write, that I might not be without social com-panions in a country where I was a stranger. My heart was and certainly ever shall be overflowing with gratitude, at the kind regard of this beloved friend, who took me by the hand with a parental care &amp; introduced me to those across the Atlantic, who he wished to show that kindness to me, he would have done himself were he there: he pro-posed in the evening introducing me to others of his acquaintance, who had also friends in England to whom they might give me letters; but having seen advertised (sp. advertized) that Pizarro (sp. Pizarra) in Peru [DR3][DR4]was to be acted, that night I could not lose the opportunity of seeing it, for I thought it must contain something interest-ing: therefore after tea I withdrew from this pleasing party with some reluctance, though led by my inclination to take a view of the Atrocities of Pizarro the heroism of Rolla (sp. Rollo) [DR5]the affection &amp; delicacy of Cora &amp; the tender love &amp; philanthropic feelings of Alonzo. 
This tragedy gives many striking proofs of the force of passion on the human character as well where it animates cold reason to elevate the manly virtues, as where it degrades man to a ferocious beast, or earthly demon Ð I cannot omit giving you some description of it although it may be imperfect. A number of armed Spaniards appear with a Peruvian captive in the midst Ð he undauntedly upbraids them with their injustice cruelty and oppression, enraged at this a Spaniard thrusts him through with a sword, and he falls.
Then a number of Peruvians, with their Inca &amp; the virgins of the Sun, enter the Temple they had dedi-cated to that celestial orb of light. The Inca</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="25">
        <p>presents an offering and all join in singing praise, this passed, the warriors prepared for battle, they said we fight for a King we love a God whom we adore; Rolla (sp. Rollo) in taking farewell of Cora the wife of his friend Alonzo showed his heart burned with a secret passion, that virtue and the honor of friendship used their utmost force to smother, Alonzo bid farewell to his wife &amp; child with an affection apparently less warm, in going to the battle told his friend Rolla (sp. Rollo), that should he fall, to him he confided his wife and child Ð The fight commences the Peruvians turn their backs Rolla (sp. Rollo) rallies them, they return to the fight, and become victorious, in the mean time the Inca wounded &amp; retiring is taken by a party of Spaniards, who had got in the rear of the Peruvians; an aged warrior blind and a boy who led him are accidentally present at this catastrophe, and while the old man laments the loss of a beloved sovereign with the sincere affection of a loyal subject Ð Rolla (sp. Rollo) makes his appearance in search of him &amp; on learning the rout they had taken, gives pursuit with a party of warriors Ð the old man in the ecstasy of hope and fear desires the boy to climb a precipice and view the issue of the contest, for Rolla (sp. Rollo) the soul and glory of Peruvian warriors will fall or conquer says the Old man Ð does he overtake them, yes almost the boy replies Ð now they vomit smoke, yes fire and smoke are the weapons of those demons, reiterates the old man Ð the boy, they close and the sword of Rolla (sp. Rollo) strikes like lightning Ð the smoke dissipates, the Spaniards are fled and Rolla (sp. Rollo) is in close embrace with the King. 
The Peruvians meet after the battle, and the Inca ex-pressing how far the valor and conduct of Rolla (sp. Rollo) compels him to show him the highest honor in his power, takes a chain of gold and puts it round his neck.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="26">
        <p>Alonzo is missing and Cora becomes disconsolate some suppose him slain, Rolla (sp. Rollo) mentions the charge he had received from his friend, when they went to battle. She rails at him, as having for this reason neglected to succor his friend and wilfully sacrific-ing him to his passion Ð the generous heart of Rolla (sp. Rollo) was susceptibly afflicted at this reproach Ð he learns that Alonzo is prisoner in the Spanish camp Ð disguises himself in the habit of a priest, presents himself before the sentinel (sp. centinel) petitioning entrance to the captive, who is doomed to death the next day Ð the sentinel (sp. centinel) refuses according to the orders he had received, he offers him gold he becomes enraged at his presuming to tempt his honor Ð he then asked him if he does not know the affection of a parent or a husband, he answered in the affirmative and that in his native village he had left a wife he loved and tender children, then were you on the point of death leaving a beloved wife and child; would it not [] your heart to be deprived the opportunity of sending them your last blessing &amp; farewell through the friendly medium of a religious father Ð the sentinel (sp. centinel) melts in tears &amp; bids him pass Ð Rolla (sp. Rollo) exclaims alone, the Spaniards have also men among them, this man refused my gold, yet in sympathizing the unfortunate he admits, here he had a hard bent generous contest with his friend to put on the priests garment &amp; for letting him take his place Ð Rolla (sp. Rollo) representing the peculiar distress of Cora should he die, in the most lively colors; with his noble perseverance at last prevails on his friend to leave him there Ð Alonzo puts on the garment and goes Ð Cora is lamenting his loss in a wood, she hears a voice call-ing her by name Ð imagining it to be that of Alonzo she runs to meet him, leaving the child asleep under a tree Ð in the meantime two Spaniards who had been separated from the main body, and had lost themselves</p>

        <p>accidentally pass there, and find the child, they take it and with it the soul of Cora and Alonzo, who returning discover that the child has been taken away, and almost undistracted; - In the Spanish Camp Piz-arroÕs wife pleads with him for Alonzo: but finding him implacable goes to the dungeon to release him Ð in his place she finds Rolla and urges him to take a dagger, she brings, and revenge the wrong of his country, by killing the tyrant, he takes it, and is conducted by her to PizarroÕs apartment, but finding him asleep, he hesitates at striking the dishonorable blow, he awakes, and yet Rolla tells him take notice a Peruvian can forgive throwing the dagger at his feet Ð the Soldier who had been centinel is accused of having betrayed his trust Ð Rolla clears him &amp; entreats his pardon, which Pizarro grants; and after in vain, entreating Rolla to remain with him, and become his friend, he gives him leave to return home Ð on the skirts of the camp, a Spanish patrol takes him up, and bring him back, Pizarro again gives him his liberty, and a sword wherewith to defend himself on his way Ð In the instant, the child of Alonzo is brought in by the two Spaniards; Rolla recog-nizes it &amp; begs it most earnestly, and in the passionate warmth, wherein he entreats, he lets fall some words which informs Pizarro to whom the child belongs, who exults in having got it in his power, the father having escaped him, as by this means he yet had a hold on him Ð Rolla finding Pizarro inflexible to his entreaties, seizes the child with one arm &amp; draws his sword with the other Ð and threatening death to whoever might presume to</p>

In any manner my Dear friend I am incapable of describing these interesting scenes with the force and elegance they deserve much less in the hasty composition of a letter; but I could not omit giving you some account of that which so much affected me with I know not what sensation of grief and pleasure, grief at the misfortunes of the wretched, and pleasure in viewing so lively a description of the exer-cise of the manly virtues Ð so much was I lost in imagining what I saw to be real; that had there not been sufficient obstructions in my way to bring me to my recollection again I could not have avoided running to the aid of Rolla. 
You know that I was before in this city at the time our Hathen troops held it; but being then a boy and incapable of much observation, it seems much the same as if this had been the first time I had ever seen it Ð from the names of places however, that I recollect them to have been the skirts of the town, &amp; which appear now to be nearly its center I find it has been much extended; the bustle in its streets &amp; forest of masts in its harbour, immediately striking the mind of the stranger with an idea of its extensive trade: The Hudson River into which the Mohawk falls above Albany &amp; which is here a mile wide washes one side of it, and what they call the East River, (which is, more properly speaking, a channel that separates Long Island from the continent) the other Ð the figure</p>

        <p>of it is nearly triangular; but of this I cannot be certain, as I have not found any eminence from which I could take a view of the whole and have not time at present to make a circuit of it Ð it is situate on a kind of island, formed by the water already mentioned, and a creek which by the aid of a Canal communicates with both Ð we crossed this KingÕs bridge about 13 miles from the city Ð It was anciently called by our Nephews, that branch of the Delaware, who possessed this country Manhattan the same as Men-atne in the Dialect we are most acquainted with which im-plies insular Ð it is now supposed to be the place of greatest trade of any within the United States, in which much British property is concerned Ð I am told that at the conclusion of the war, the Virginians defrauded the British Merchants of all they were indebted to them; which this state and some others honorably paid Ð the consequence has been that credit could be readily attained of Britain by the Mer-chants of this City, and those who had been less honest were constrained to buy the Merchandize, they wanted of them, and let their trade go through their hands; so you see in this case as you will in many others, the proved verified, that honesty is the best policy Ð for although the United States have separated from Great Britain, their own interest &amp; necessity oblige them to give her the preference in trade; her extensive manufactures Ð the wealth &amp; honorable brethren are at the present time more benefited by the trade of America than they were before the separation; at the same time that they have a saving of the expense they were at in governing &amp; defending so extensive an Empire Ð such my Dear friend is the short sighted wisdom of mortals, that even men of great powers of</p>

      <div type="page" n="30">
        <p>mind did not foresee these consequences of America obtaining Independence, which has taken place in so few years; but lavish-ed blood and treasure to prevent it Ð and to the honor of British humanity it may be said that in general the mild manner in which they carried on this war, in most parts paying honorably for what they wanted, helped the Americans not a little, by the vast sums of money they expended in the country Ð which if as Europeans say it is the sinews of war, it certainly is the flesh &amp; blood of trade, nourishing the sinews of industry. Flour the produce of this State Ð cotton indigo &amp; tobacco from those of the South &amp; perhaps other articles, I did not perceive are exported from here to Great Britain and they receive in return much of their cotton manu-factured into caleions &amp; other stuff, with broad cloth, cutlery, &amp; many things; I am unacquainted with; but I believe all are principally manufactured articles &amp; few or no raw materials: for what supports the trade of America is the labors of the country which being fertile, extensive and enjoying variety of climate, produces a diversity of articles for a foreign market Ð what may be the support of that of England, I presume I shall be better able to inform you of when I am there, if the Great I hint permits me to cross the Atlantic in safety. I am first going to embark in what you would call a great canoe, though she is not very great, when compared with the other canoes that cross the Great Salt Lake, she is stowed full of bales of cotton, some also on duke &amp; I find the cabin so full of these articles and packed of deerskin from New Orleans, that I can hardly get to my berth Ð my lodging over the brigdeen do not promise to be the most comfortable a Chippe-wa wigwam would be more pleasant, but a man is born to bear inconveniences, Adieu</p>

      <div type="page" n="31">
        <p>Liverpool April 25, 1804
My Dear friend, 
I was on the eve of embarking, when I wrote you from New York, we however did not get off till the next day the 18th of March, so that I enjoyed another evening the society of my worthy benevolent friend: we sailed with a fine breeze from the NW, soon clearing the land, we stood rather to the South of East, the first two days to clear Nantucket Shoals, then made our direct course Ð the wind veered to the South &amp; on the 24th rather to the Eastward of South which obliged us to go close hauled, that is the sails hauled in such a manner, as for the ship to lay the closest to the wind possible, rather stormy and in the evening one of the seamen jumped overboard in a fit of lunacy. 
The poor man had appeared deranged a day or two before, saying the devil was after him, when he was going to the mast head, he asked an old shoe or a piece of iron from the Captain to give the Evil spirit by which he imagined himself haunted, that it might leave him. 
The next day we pass the skirts of the banks of Newfoundland, where codfish are caught in great abun-dance, canned and sent to different parts; but principally to Spain and Portugal, where the inhabitants keep lent with this food Ð The people from the sea coast of New England gain great advantage from their activity and industry in this fishery. 
I make no doubt, but you are in admiration, how men can direct, to any particular point, so earnestly a vessel over the landless and pathless Ocean, considering the various couny they are obliged to make from change of winds Ð and had I not acquired some idea of navigation, I might account for it in the same manner, that some writers do for our finding the way through extensive forests, that is, that they do it by instinct Ð this however is not the case any more</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="32">
        <p>than with us. The mariners have a compass such or nearly such as those you have seen with surveyors, by this they know the course they make, and the distance they go on each is found by the log Ð this is a flat piece of wood of a triangular form with lead run into the broad end, to the small end is affixed a line which marked into distances of miles called knots in the same proportion to a mile as the small glass bears to an hour: when the log is thrown the glass is turned, and as soon as run our, the line is stopped; which being hauled in, gives the number of miles the vessel makes per hour Ð these &amp; the various courses are calculated every four twenty hours, to find the direct course and distance made; thus the Capt comes to a knowledge of where his ship sails; as we do, by revolving in our minds the different turns we have made in pursuit of the game and length of time we have went on each direction, what half of the forest we are in Ð this calculation we are enabled to correct by notices we take of hills rivers &amp; variety of grounds Ð and the mariner corrects his by an observation he takes of the sun every day at twelve oÕclock, when the sky is clear, which shows him exactly how far he is to the north of the equator Ð which is called latitude Ð there is also a method to take an observation of the moon, called longitude Ð this however, I learn is more diffi-cult, and not so exact, as that of the latitude Ð and is seldom practised, as I understand, except in ships of war and East Indian men, who make long voyages. The others remedy this by keeping a good lookout for land Ð The Navigator must be very careful, that he is not deceived in his calculation by the log, through any defect in the glass, the influence of currents or swell of the sea on the log or motion of the ship; and must also guard against any negligence in the helmsmen or those who throw the log. They have books and maps, which give them a correct knowledge of the ports and habors they sail to. 
After passing the banks we were much thwarted by contrary winds; but when we had a spurt of one that was favorable we made good way, for the ship, like most American vessels, sails very well Ð we were driven so far to the Northward by the wind, that at one time, the Captain had intended to go by the Channels to the North of Ireland Ð near this coast we met a ship from Liverpool long. 17th Ð The wind coming more favorable we lay for the South Channel, and on the 17th of April discovered the Blanquets on the Irish coast. The sight of land rejoiced the hearts of all, but particularly the passengers, who althoÕ we had not had a long voyage, yet seemed to think it long. An English gentleman, naturalized in America in a mercantile line of business, whose affairs required his attendance in England at a particular day, was very fretful, when the wind blew against us, and could not be reconciled to its inattentive rudeness in not corresponding with his wishes Ð out Captain did not show much more patience, he was everla-menting to the loss he would incur by being too long on this voyage, for he was engaged by the trip. He was not however a regular bred seaman; but had gone to sea since a man grown Ð</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="34">
        <p>I received particular joy at seeing, within the smell of the land, an Old Yorkshire man of forescore who had left his son a merchant in New York, to breath his last in his native land; far from the continued storms we met &amp; feeble situation he was in from sea sickness I had been apprehensive we should have lost him on the passage. 
Coasting the Southwest shore of Ireland on that 18th in the evening we made Cork, where we were becalmed Ð we met there a ship we had seen two days before at a distance, she was an armed vessel of Liverpool, that had been at Barbados, and was now returning, she had on board the Governor, and suite of a Dutch settlement in the West Indies, lately taken by the British troops Ð There is not much appearance of verdure yet on shore Ð or it might in some respect afford a beautiful prospect Ð but they have a disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with jibbets [DR6]here and there Ð Is it not surprising, that a people so enlightened, so humane and so polite should have it so arranged, that the first object striking the view of the strangers, who approach their shore should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and depravity of some of their people. Telegraphs were also to be seen on every eminence Ð this is a late invention to communicate intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give orders to the ships of the Navy Ð they are on a line of communica-tion within distinct view of each other Ð attain figures are put up which are repeated from one</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="35">
        <p>to the other without being understood by any but those from whom the orders issue and the commanders of North. We there learnt, by the boats which came from the shore, that all was of yet tranquil, that they had only heard of the threats of Bonaparte which it was not likely, he would be able to put in execu-tion. 
After night a fair wind springing up, we made sail, and next morning, we were abreast of Wicklow Moun-tains, the land is high and elevated, but we were at too great a distance to distinctly view it Ð On the 21st we sailed along the Welsh Coast and passed Holyhead Ð here is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are covered with snow, which although they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility of the country, yet the natural majestic grandeur of the asylum of the descendants of ancient Britons strikes the mind with veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of their ancestors who preferred breathing the air of freedom on Rocky Mountains to remaining in subjection on their native fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their hero the gallant Caractacus. 
In the evening a Pilot comes on board and next day we arrive safe in dock here, the pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but those, who have made a long voyage. AlthoÕ this was Sunday and business lulled at rest, yet sufficient was to be seen to give a stranger some conception of the magnitude of the trade carried on at this place Ð the many store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland canals and docks all denote wealth &amp; exertion, these last are of two kind wet and dry, the latter are to receive vessels to be repaired; the former are for</p>
      </div>

        <p>At present the military ardor of the citizens appears, as striking as their commerce and industry; there are number-less regiments of volunteers, some composed entirely of gentle-men, and who are at no expense whatever to the country others of tradesmen, and working people of various descriptions these receive their arms &amp; uniforms, and are paid when called out. They all make a very fine appearance, and show themselves expert in the various military evolutions Ð and should the enemy make good his landing, I think what they may be deficient in discipline, they will supply in spirit. 
On the 24th the festival of St George being passed I called on a friend to whom the worthy gentleman, I mentioned at New York had given me letters of introduction, Mr Cropper, which was the gentlemanÕs name received me kindly send-ing a young gentleman to show me the things curious to be seen in the city and environs Ð we visited the canals, which communicate with the interior, to a great distance by these weighty articles are conveyed much cheaper than they could be by land Ð this is what we cannot think of imitating in our parts should we even be-come industrious and laborious in the extreme, we must yet be content with the canals nature has bestowed on us; in which indeed she has been very liberal Ð for those effected by the industry of man, require an extensive population engaged in commercial connection to support them, which is the case here, even the coals wanted for the fuel of this city, and which are brought by this convenience, appear to be more than adequate</p>

      <div type="page" n="38">
        <p>by the sowing thereby made in carriage, to defray the expence I saw sufficient to convince me of the active commercial genius of the people of this city their entreprizing spirit &amp; wealth; but perhaps not so much as otherwise I would have done, had not the military parade going on of militia and volunteers drawn my attention to them. with which all was animated, cannons roaring, and volleys of marquetry resounding all over. 
I visited the establishment made by the gentlemen of this place for reading the newspapers, here they, or strangers introduced by any of them, enter and read the news of the day, also an extensive library of books in which are deposited the knowledge acquired by ages: thus you see European over exert their faculties to obtain wisdom, why then should we wonder if they rise superior to the rest of mankind, when they do not bury under ground the talents given them by the Great Father of all; but use every endeavor to add thereto increase. 
I spent the evening with my friend Mr Cropper, who hospitably entertained me with friendly con-versation, as well as good fare; an inquiry being made of the occurrences in our path, I am afraid vanity and affection led me to expatiate too much on the exploits of our western brethren to which I had been a witness &amp; although I did not depart from truth, yet I felt criminal in attributing perhaps too much to their valor, the success due to the favor of the Great Spirit.

        <p>Glasgow, May 3, 1804
Dear friend, 
When I last left you I was going to see reviewed a Regiment of Dragoons; with which sight I was much gra-tified; every evolution they performed with as much exactness as infantry could have done; but with much more velocity it is astonishing the perfection to which they have brought the tractability of the horses, charging, changing ground, sub-dividing into divisions, &amp; every other manouvre is perform-ed without the least confusion. 
The evening, I past pleasantly, with my friends, and next morning the 26th left Liverpool in the stage Ð the neigh-boring country was as denotive of rural industry, as the city of commerce, all affording a beautiful landscape of gentlemenÕs seats, woods, and lawns, and farms culti-vated with the greatest skill and neatness. 
As usual we proceeded a considerable distance together before we began to be acquainted; two ladies who continued the whole rout to Carlisle became agreeably conversa-ble, and after dark I think at Kendal, we were joined by a gentleman, who was a very agreeable addition, for he was very civil and well uniformed &amp; in the habit of travelling; however I regret the having travelled so far in the night as it entirely deprived me of a view of Cumberland, which I am told is very picturesque. In the morning we arrived at Carlisle, where our companion the gentleman proposed taking jointly with me a post chaise to go to Glasgow, this I agreed to, and after breakfast, we proceeded leaving one of the ladies, who was going to the Isle of Man, and the other we took with us to Lory-town where she was going.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="40">
        <p>From the entry into Scotland for a considerable distance the road passes through a fine country, cultivated with great indus-try and skill, rendering the landscape such a most beautiful picture of nature and art, as could not fail attracting attention &amp; ex-citing admiration; except when the eyes were drawn from these inanimate objects to view the blooming complexions, and the frank and cheerful countenances of the country lads and lasses. We dine at a little town called Mofffat, and then proceed over hills, and heaths to Elfinfoot [DR7]Ð my companion I find both polite and agreeable, and unless when interrupted by sleigh, for we had travelled all the proceeding night Ð a great deal of conversation passed between us; thus my friend have I found man in general wherever I can con-verse with them either Polite and agreeable, silent through pride or modesty peevishly critical or dull and uninteresting Ð but harm-less until their self love be thwarted, then it is they show their real character Ð we should never therefore be off our guard, that this passion does not lead us out of the right way, and tempt us to do more than justice to ourselves at the expense of our neighbors, even in the most trifling concerns; it is preferable to condescend than controvert, when the welfare or honor of none may be there by injured. 
We sleep at Elfinfoot and next morning early proceed, we breakfast at Douglas Mill pass through Hamilton, and take a view of the Duke of HamiltonÕs house a grand antique fabric, arrive at Glasgow on the 28th of April at about two oÕclock, in the afternoon</p>

        <p>After dinner I call on Doctor Anderson; but did not find him at home, I met however with a pleasing reception from his family and the next morning had the pleasure of breakfasting with him: my cousin is blest with a fine family Ð the next day I spent in going to see my other cousin Mr John Anderson, and viewing the different parts of the city, which is regular, extensive, populous and of great trade, and in that respect is by some re-puted the third city in the Kingdom: dine with the Doctor and pass the evening with him very agreeably he being a gentleman of very extensive and correct knowledge; he proposes next day a trip to Lough Lo-man in which we are accompanied by a Mr Hender-son a relation, in our way we take a view of the ancient castle of Dunbarton on the Clyde, which was formerly thought impregnable Ð as yet it seems to be of no contemptible natural strength Ð for the high land, which commands it, seems to be at too great a dis-tance to be able to annoy it much; from there Ð we proceed to leave on Lough Loman, where we dine but unfortunately the weather is too misty to have an extensive view of the Lake as we had</p>

Edinburgh May 17, 1804
Dear friend, I arrived at this city on the evening of the day in which I left Glasgow. &amp; Next day called on my aunt and cousin, the only relations I had been personally acquainted with when a boy Ð I was peculiarly happy on see-ing them again; it recalled to my mind the recol-lection of the happy days of childhood, when I was yet blessed with a tender and affectionate pa-rent Ð after the first emotions, we began to con-verse on the motives which caused me to under-take the journey Ð that which respected your affairs was sufficiently pleasing, and satisfactory but my own individual intention of serving in the war was not so well thought of Ð however as they could not bring me to think like them, nor I could change their sentiments, we dropt the subject Ð</p>

The troops here are either fencibles or volunteers, who seem to perform the various military evolutions, with great correctness Ð they have same riflemen here, or as they stile them, sharp shooters, but they are not near so numerous, as the corps of that description at Glasgow. 
I was present at a sham fight the other day; where there was undoubtedly, as much noise, as might have done for a real fight, it took place on the shore of the Firth, and was intended to imitate an attempt to make a landing, and the conse-quent opposition; - the gunboats approached the shore find their canook, which were returned by the artillery on shore; a party attempted to land; but they were beaten off, as were the boats, after the roaring of cannon for a considerable time.</p>

My Dear friend, 
On leaving this city, I travelled through a pleasant country for a great part of the way, till I arrived at the QueenÕs Ferry, which is about two miles across; this I passed and landed in Fife-shire, then proceeded towards Dunfermlin[DR8]; through a country, which in some parts appears barren, and in others fertile, and well cultivated; it is par-ticularly of this latter description in the vicinity of the town Ð I arrived there and called upon my Cousin Careful, who received me with much kindness and after passing some time at another relationÕs house, in the evening, he entertained me with his history Ð which was one series of persevering industry and frugality Ð and had been so far crown-ed with success, that he now saw himself possessed of what would be considered a great fortune in Canada, and settled in an extensive business. The town of Dunfermlin is cele-brated for having been a favorite place of resi-dence to many of the Scottish Kings Ð the adja-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="48">
        <p>cent country is beautified by a careful cultivation the ground fertilized to as great an extent as it will admit by manure, and appearances promise abundant harvest. 
Here was anciently a magnificent Abbey and palace of the ancient Kings of Scotland, in it the Princess Elizabeth daughter of James the sixth, and mother of the Princess Sophia from whom the King is descended, was born. 
[long blank space]
On the 20th Mr C_ took me to Kincardine where his brother resides, he appears to be agreeably married, and well settled in business, we proceed to Saline, and I there see my cousins, who yet inhabit, near the old place of residence of my mothers family Ð Mr G_ goes home and leaves me with them, the next day I am taken to see the Farm, where my deceased Grand Father</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="49">
        <p>passed his life, and where my much regretted mother was born Ð This object caused many sensations to rise at the recollection of her tender care during my childhood, and the affection she ever expressed for her native place Ð how transient are the days of mortals did I say Ð what a little space of time seems to have elapsed, since I listened with pleasure to her narratives of her infantine years, and seen the tear of filial affection start in her eye when she came to mention the caresses and tender words of her beloved Father Ð and now she is no more; but is I hope with those she loved in paradise Ð does not the daily incidents of life continually reiterate to the reflecting mind, the same doctrines with the word of God, it demonstrates, that our business here is to lead a good life, devoting it to the glory of God, and to the promotion of the permanent</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="50">
        <p>happiness of our fellow creatures, to cast aside all anxiety for its length and to leave that to the disposal of him who gave it Ð at the same time does not the frailty of our nature, which so often renders abortive the good resolutions we take, show how much we stand in need of a redeemer, and how impossible it would be for us, by our own merits, to appear justified before a pure, a holy and a just God; but the intercession of our blessed Lord Jesus is the hope, and stand by of those, who sincerely love him, and, actuated by that love, obey his com-mandments: My cousin appeared also affected, both at recollection of those, who are now no more, and to see the place, they had passed so many happy days in, gone to decay Ð the fertility of the ground itself seems to have been exhausted;</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="51">
        <p>In this country, unless the land is regularly manured, and the crops varied with great care it soon becomes unfruitful; there are also many considerable tracts, which, I believe, bid almost defiance to art to fertilize, these are barren heaths, and rocky mountains, the soil of which perhaps is destitute of any nutritive quality Ð the vallies, however, with some considerable parcels of land are tolerably productive Ð and it strikes me, that notwith-standing the neatness and industry with which the farmers cultivate the soil they occupy, and the great population of the country in proportion to its extent and fertility, which I believe is quite as much, as the natural productions can sustain Ð there are yet vast tracts which is waste that with some considerable expence of labor might be rendered produc-tive of the necessaries of life Ð but the nation-al character of the Scotch, I think is rather enterprising than industrious, and they are</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="52">
        <p>more intent on improving their talents (which undoubtedly are the most valuable of the two) than of their soil Ð thus many adventurers have their country in the character of soldiers, sailors, civilians, and merchants Ð the love of their country, which no nation possesses in a greater degree, cause many of the fortunate to return with vast accumulations of wealth; but perhaps not many of these expend much of their riches in enriching their native soil, and thereby increasing the natural wealth of their country Ð thus the artificial wealth, or that derived from specie, becomes too dis-proportionate to the natural wealth, or that derived from the natural productions of the country, and by raising provisions to a high price, checks the progress of manufactures; yet the temperance and frugality of the laboring people of Scotland, the invention of the steam engine, and</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="53">
        <p>great abundance of coal, by which this machine is supported, hold them up against this difficulty. 
In the evening after this promenade, I visit Mr H_ at Luton stone, he was a full cousin to my deceased mother. From him and his family I received the warmest tokens of sincere affection. On the 23 we proposed a trek to the cauldron Lynn [DR9]Ð a great natural curiosity of this country Ð it is a small stream, that falls with great vehemence from a consider-able height into a stone hollowed, by the force of the water, into something of the shape of a large kettle, as the name implies Ð the scenery is grand, and perhaps beautiful in pleasant weather, but this happened to be rather stormy and showry, the lofty heads</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="54">
        <p>of the Ochal Hills [DR10]covered with mist Ð the rustling wind, that hastened on the black clouds, and the roaring of the steam, dashing against the rocks below, absorbed so much of our attention, that it is likely many other objects escaped unseen Ð 
I remained at Saline a week, which I passed very happy, feeling the continual glow of af-fection run through all my veins, at being with those of my kindred, who before, I never had had the pleasure of seeing Ð this time I pass in visiting others of my relations, who inhabit round Saline Hill, and in viewing the surrounding country; I am told how-ever that it is not so populous, as for-merly, and yet the general population of Scotland has increased, this causes me to suspect, that the increase has been only in the cities, and that that</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="55">
        <p>valuable class of men, the peasantry who are the substantial strength of nations, have decreased Ð but I hope the great and benevolent patriots may find some remedy for this evil, if it has commenced, before it may too far injure the country, and let that encourage-ment be given the cultivators of the earth, that too great a number of them, may not be drove, to the smoky city, to look for a subsistence. 
On the 28th I return to Dunfermline, where I remain two days; meeting my aunt there on a visit to Mrs M_, I dine there with the Miss M_us who are also my relations Ð and we pass a very agreeable afternoon together. 
On the 31st return to this city and on the 2nd of June have an interview with</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="56">
        <p>the E_ of M_[DR11] he gave me a letter to L_ C_ referring me to him Ð I intended going by land to London, and to pass by Glasgow; but my Cousin advises me to take my passage in a smack Ð On enquiry I find that one sails on Sunday, and the other on Wednesday, the latter of which I prefer; but afterwards learn that it being a fast day, she cannot clear out on the usual day, and in consequence defer until Friday at 3 oÕclock.
On Wednesday evening, I am called upon by Sir J_ H_ and some other gentle-men, who are eager in researches respecting America, they retire apparently satisfied with the information they receive, and Sir J_ does me the honor to invite me to dinner the next day Ð I went as I promised, was introduced to Lady E_</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="57">
        <p>and met several men of eminence there the friends of Sir J_ the conversation turned chiefly on the nature of our country and character of the inhabitants, which cer-tainly gave me as much pleasure to com-municate, as it could to them to receive the information Ð you however had only the pleasing side of your character given and I left to their own judgement to im-agine the rest Ð for although we should always say nothing, but the truth, it is not necessary always to tell all the truth Ð in short I thought it sufficient to expose the faults of the Five Nations to themselves, that they might thereby acquire an aversion for them; but here where none were, I could only recollect the good qualities they yet possess Ð and therefore</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="58">
        <p>buried them in the general description of less contaminated tribes. 
On Friday I learn that the clerk of the ship-ping office had deceived me &amp; that the vessel had sailed on the usual day, I am there-fore constrained to take my passage in a Imach going to sail on Sunday: I endeavor to go to Kircaldy [DR12]a town on the Fife shore of the Firth; but am prevented by the wind Ð (scribbled out lines) blowing too strong.
Therefore I conclude it would be inexcu-sable did I not give you some description of this city, which has from an early period been the capital of Scotland Ð It is divided into three parts, the old town which is the most ancient, extended from East to West a mile; gradually apending from Holyrood</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="59">
        <p>house to the Castle on the West, where it became an eminence and except that part facing the city, which is very narrow, the castle is inaccessi-ble on all sides to clumsy people, being built on a steep and craggy rock, for this reason it was deemed a place of great strength before the use of cannon; but the commanding grounds in its neighborhood, at present under it of no great importance, unless against a sudden attack Ð however this is of no con-sequence for it has always been the maxim of the Scots to depend on their valor rather than fortifications for the defence of their coun-try Ð and should it now be put to the test I hope that God may inspire with exalted courage every patriotic Briton, and render successful their exertions in defense of their King, their country and their religion. 
On the north of this hill, as far nearly as it extends lies the North Lough, which</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="60">
        <p>is now drained, and in some parts built on in others covered with gardens Ð over it is built an elegant bridge of stone, communi-cating between the old and new town Ð in the old town the High Street, which from Holyrood House to the Castle, is the only one that has any thing to be said in its praise Ð it is wide, strait and well paved on the sides with flag, and in the middle with round stone Ð the houses in general well built and high, there are hardly any streets that descend from it on each side, but mostly narrow passages, called wynds, which scarcely ever see the light of the sun Ð the street which crosses it, from the north to the South bridges, is a fine street, which if you continue on after passing over the Cow gate from a view of which much pleasure is not to be</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="61">
        <p>derived, you arrive at the pleasant or South part of the town, here are well laid out streets, and elegant buildings, some fine squares, and throughout the whole a free circu-lation of air Ð I had omitted mentioning that in the old town, adjoining the Tabboth or prison, is an ancient square, called the Parliament Close, in the midst of it stands a statue of King Charles Ð on one side of this square stands the building, where the Scottish Parliaments were formerly held Ð the buildings are lofty and grand, and in the ancient stile 
A small distance to the South of the grass market, which is situate in the hollow South of the Castle Hill, commencing at the western end of the low Gate and ending at the West Gate of the city, stands HeriotÕs Hospital, a grand antique building, which was erected, by the ma, whose name it bears, for the education of the children of distressed Jewellers, and endowed with, I be-lieve, all his property, which is said to have been considered Ð this was done more than</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="62">
        <p>two hundred years ago Ð outside the city to the South is another called WatsonÕs or the TradeÕs Hospital built and endowed, by a person of that name, for the education of the sons of distressed merchants Ð this is a handsome building and situate in pleasant fields, outside of the crowd of buildings, the youth there educated appear to be numerous. 
This third &amp; most elegant division of Edinburg is that called the New Town situate to the North of the North Lough, along which it extends, from side of the Calton Hill, perhaps three quarters of a mile West Ð the streets are at right angles capacious and strait the houses elegantly built of free stone interspersed with elegant squares and all laid out in such a manner as to form the most beautiful town imagin-able Ð here may be enjoyed the pleasures of society, without being deprived of the healthy country air, which has every</p>

      <div type="page" n="63">
        <p>where free circulation through the wide streets: a convenience not enjoyed in cities in general, particularly those built according to the ancient mode, in which, the principal object seems to have been, to crowd as a great a number of houses and as great a population, as the extent of ground could admit without any regard to taste, ele-gance or comfort. 
This city does not, in all appearance, like Glasgow, derive its principal support from trade; but rather from the great concourse of the nobility and gentry, who are drawn here by the love of society, as in search of knowledge, the univer-sity, and the great number of the professors at law, who make this their residence, the high courts of this country being here here - &amp; the supplying to the wants and luxuries of the whole finds employ for the mechanic of the city, and peasant of the campaign. 
Leith is the seaport and situate about two miles from the old city on the shores of</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="64">
        <p>Firth, it is of considerable extent, and from the bustle of business, and number of vessels lying in the harbor, it is apparent, that a trade of some extent is carried on there Ð the har-bor is a very small river, into which the tide flows to a considerable height, farther aided by a stone pier, projecting a con-siderable distance into the Firth, this is an arm of the sea, which separates the Lothians from Fife shire, the mouth of which is perhaps upwards of twenty miles wide, but here it narrows to about six, and farther to the west is yet more narrow, there the River Forth disembogue, into it, by means of which a canal is made to communicate between this Firth of Forth, and the Clyde, through which vessels of ninety tons pass Ð the fabricators have been necessitated Ð from the unevenness of the ground, in some places, to erect bridges from mountain to moun-</p>

The Lothains three counties distinguished by the names of East Middle, and West which lie on the Southern shore of the Firth, and Fife, on the Northern, are generally speaking, fertile, and in high cultivation, and the neigh-boring sea abounds in fish Ð here none of the natural productions that are useful, either of sea or land, are neglected, but rather when circumstances may admit are increased by labor and art: but as I sail tomorrow, I must now bid you adieu to prepare for my voyage.</p>

As I have now entered this river through which passes the treasures of the world and as we are meeting every instant ships of all nations of which the Americans bear no small proportion, I again write you, intending to send it by some of them Ð

In the evening we were opposite to Berwick upon Tweed, a town situate between England, and Scotland, apparently under the jurisdiction of neither, for it is an asylum to smugglers, who cheat the revenues, perhaps this is derived from some privileges granted this place, while Great Britain was divided into two Kingdoms, and which it yet retains inviolable. 
The next day we made but little progress being becalmed near an island I think called Holy Island Ð On Wednesday we are opposite to Shields the Seaport to Newcastle, which together with Sun-derland furnish great part of the coals, that are used in London, and the other Southern parts of the Kingdom; These two places which are only about</p>

This place, however, is said to be much subject to the fever and ague, as also the op-posite shore of Thint, of which I had not so perfect a view, as we enter the River; pass the Midway where many ships of war lie Ð the Rentish shore has a beauti-ful appearance interspersed with woods and lawns gently rising into hills Ð we anchor at Gravesend; and here I conclude.</p>

My Dear friend
Early in the morning weighed anchor and proceeded up the river with the tide, the banks of this noble stream, which conveys, to the me-tropolis of the civilized world, the wealth or produce of all the countries on the earth, for which they receive in return the fruits of her superior industry and skill Ð is beautiful in many parts by gentlemenÕs villas; but twelve miles, or thereabouts before arriving at the city, both sides are covered with populous villages, here forests of masts and the multiplied operations of man attract the attention from other objects to contemplate the changes made on the face of nature by the hand of art, and that active principal im-planted in the nature of man, which causes them to seek each other out, in the most distant parts of the globe, to exchange the varied productions of the different</p>

        <p>climates they inhabit, or those derived from the peculiar genius of each, and degree of improve-ment they may have arrived at in the useful arts, or in those which contribute to gratify the luxury or elegant taste of the great.
Numbers of poor miserable convicts, the victims of their crimes, are employed in chains, on board of launches, throwing ballast, thus making reparation to their country, the laws of which they had contemned Ð We pass Wool-which, which is the great place of ordinance to the Kingdom, as we ascend the crowd of masts becomes greater. At Greenwich there is an extensive asylum for disabled sailors or for those worn out by years and service, that is liberally supported by govern-ment Ð the crowd of vessels on each side the River, became so great, that there remained, but a very narrow passage for us to pass through when we arrived near the tower, we met a con-siderable body of the city volunteers, going down the river in boats, perhaps to practise the art of war by imitating military movements; they made a very martial appearance Ð although some appeared rather too fat for to perform the active exertions required in war, yet I make no doubt</p>

The Tower guns are fired, and those of the armed vessels in the harbor, in salutation to this patriotic band Ð we get up to a wharf near the tower and desembark; walked through the town, with a fellow passenger an officer going to the West Indies Ð leave my letters of introduc-tion; but see none of the gentlemen to whom they were directed; I part with my friend and go back to the vessel, inquire of the Landlord at the Tavern on the wharf, where I may find lodgings in the city, he directs me to the Sus-sex Coffee house, took a coach and went there Ð the next morning, I walk out, and call L_ C_ he was kindly attentive</p>

I arrived there in the afternoon, the walk I had taken did me much good Ð I met with a hearty welcome, and received much pleasure, and instruction, from his conversation Ð after staying two days I leave them, promising to return as soon as possible Ð On Saturday evening I walk towards the city, where I had left my introduc-tory letters Ð and find that the friends, to whom I had been, thereby introduced, were making enquiry after me Ð a worthy friend Rakuhedemo Ð Mr. Allen called upon me, and invited me to his house Ð pity bene-volence and sincerity were so strongly marked on his countenance, that his kind invitation I readily accepted, rendering thanks to the Almighty for having led me into such ac-</p>

In our way home we called at a house where we met the Mother of my friend, a very worthy matron, and several persons of their society, which we call Yahoriwi-yosto, and the English Quakers Ð the pity, moderation &amp; benevolence depictured in their countenance, and deportment, filled my heart with affection towards them: happy seet, and happy for men could</p>

        <p>We got home and a few days after had an in-vitation to dine with Mr B_n a little ways in the country, near the New River, which fur-nishes a great part of the city with water Ð the fields have a very beautiful appearance, decorated with fine trees on their skirts. 
The hospitality of these kind friends, and the accidental manner, by which, I was in-troduced to them, filled my heart with gratitude to the Supreme Being Ð how has he led me, did I think among these virtuous worthy people: whose conversation, example, and society all contribute to set my mind at ease, and guard me against the temptations incident to such a place as London.

Shoteisyowane, who from the first addressed me as a brother American, benevolently seemed to wish to assist me, all in his power Ð a succeed-ing day he invited me Ð I then saw his son in law an amiable good natured young gentleman; who invited me to his house, that evening he also introduced me to Shakodenrhe, a very worthy gentleman member of Parliament, eminent for pity and benevolence, and continued exer-tions for doing good Ð even the oppressed slave, of the sultry tropical clime, escape not his attention he has for many years been exerting his ut-most powers, supported by many worthy friends to induce Great Britain, the guardian of liberty to abolish the disgraceful traffic in the human species, carried on to the coast of Africa Ð and to show the world, that as providence has blessed her with freedom; she will also protect the poor Africans in the enjoyment of theirs</p>

        <p>On my first arrival in town, I went to deliver a letter of introduction, I had from Ihayendan-egen for Ihorighwayere; the porter at the gate acquainted me he was very much indisposed and that he saw nobody Ð I neglected leaving my direction and therefore it was a considerable time, before I had the pleasure of seeing him, in passing the house, the Porter acquainted me, he had made enquiry after me, and that he wished to see me; as soon, as he had rose I returned, and he received me with peculiar kindness, testifyed a hearty disposition for promoting your welfare Ð the second time I was with him, he introduced me to his son, a noble youth, towards whom my heart warmed with friendship, from the noble and amiable qualities, which so conspicuously appeared in his countenance Ð shortly after he left Town; but always honored me with a correspondence. 
The valuable acquaintance I have met with in his place, since my arrival, has taken up so much of my attention</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="81">
        <p>that I have hardly thought to look at the buildings, however as I know your curiosity will require that, I say something of the appearance of the city Ð I shall describe it as well as I can
As I have already observed there is with little interruption a continuation of villages below London, Wapping where I landed is the nearest, it is separated from the city, by the Tower the an-cient Fortress, this Ð is surrounded by a wet ditch and there is a drawbridge at the gate to be taken up when necessary Ð in this place there is an immensity of arms, perhaps nearly sufficient to arm all the Nations in N. America there is the ancient armour of the Kings of England, and the arms taken from the Span-iards in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when they attempted to invade England in the pom-pous invincible Armada, which was defeated by an inferior squadron of the coast Ð these are long spears, equal in length to those used by the Chippewas to kill fish, guns with match locks, shields with an</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="82">
        <p>aperture in the centre with a pistol fixed in it to be fired with a match Ð the statue of Queen Elizabeth when she went to Tilbury to see the fleet sail Ð the Crown, &amp; Regal Jewels are also kept here in a small apartment, the appearance of which does not in the least correspond with the treasure therein con-tained Ð
On passing Tower Hill the city commences, the streets of which are very narrow and crowd-ed, so much so that it is difficult to pass; by reason of the concourse of people continually moving along Ð the distance is not great to the Street, which descends to the bridge, in this is erected a pillar of a height exceeding the tallest pine, in commemoration of the great fire of London in the Reign of King Charles when it was entirely demolished by the flames Ð it is said the streets were  much more nar-row previous to this event than they are now Ð The bridge is built of stone, and com-municates with the Borough of Southwark, I think it is about 400 yds across.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="83">
        <p>On crossing this street Lombard Street commences, near the end of it an alley leads to the Royal Exchange which is in another street Ð at this place merchants and men of business meet to tran-sact business Ð here stands the bank which contains the treasure of the Kingdom Ð from which wealth flows to the different parts of the country, and returns again by innumerable channels Ð it is like the heart in the human body, from which the blood is conveyed through the arteries and veins to nourish the different limbs all concentrating there again Ð you may per-haps say, how is it that treasure, which is only a bright metal taken from the earth, can be of so much importance to a nation, men of understanding and courage, warmed with an honest affection for their country, are a greater strength to a nation than a lifeless heap of ore, it is not with it an enemy is to be overcome, it will rather tempt his avar-ice. Ð You must know, however, that althoÕ in itself considered as a metal, it does not</p>

      <div type="page" n="84">
        <p>deserve much regard; yet in a commercial nation, so far as it supports and stimulates industry; it may be considered as its blood Ð and perhaps; where nobler sentiments are want-ing, it may sometimes incite to achievements that appear great.
At the end of Lombard Street the Poultry commences, and a little to the eastward of St PaulÕs churchyard, there is a street, which leads into Holborn, that terminates at the western extremity of the town. On viewing the Cathedral of St PaulÕs the beholder is struck with astonishment at its Grandeur and mag-nificence, its towering cupola raising its head above the clouds of smoke, that ascend from the city: in a clear day it may be seen upwards of 20 miles from London; I have seen it myself at the distance of 12 miles Ð On entering this mighty fabric a person feels yet a stronger impression as well in Reverence to the supreme to whose worship it is dedicated, as in admiration of its structure Ð the view</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="85">
        <p>is in no ways obstructed, to its utmost height, which under the prospect sublime to the highest degree. This great building is made of stones finely hewn and placed together. 
Cheap side and Fleet street leads to Temple Bar which is the extremity of the ancient bounds of the city, which were of no great extent, in comparison to what they are now Ð the strand begins here and ends at Charing cross, there a broad street on the left hand leads to the houses where the great men, transact the business of the nation, and also to the Parliament where the Lords and Commons deliberate on the measures to be taken to promote the public welfare, on the right hand of this street, there is a passage leads into St JamesÕs park, which is surrounded by gravel walks beautifully ornamented and shaded by trees, the verdant park is fenced round, and contains in the center a fine pond of water Ð Many of the houses of the nobility and gentry are on the side of this park Ð and on the Western extremi-</p>

        <p>ty is Buckingham house, where the Royal family frequently reside Ð to the right there is a path leads through fields to the end of Picadilly and corner of Hyde Park, here the crowd of buildings may be said to end Ð but there is a continu-ation of Villages joining each other to a much greater distance Ð the city of Westminster and the borough of Southwark have become one with London Ð three bridges cross the Thames within their limits, all built of stone, London Ð Blackfriars, and Westmin-ster, of these the Blackfriars appears to be the handsomest.
The whole extends from East to West miles and from North to South miles it is said to contain upwards of a million of inhabitants, which is certainly not to be doubted Ð There are several manufactures car-ried on here to great extent and perfection, but the produce of all the manufacturing towns in the Kingdom concentrate here as does also that which is brought from the most distant parts of the earth.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="87">
        <p>Notwithstanding the great extent of this city, the crowded buildings, narrow streets and extraordinary population, it is yet amazingly healthy; this may be caused by the natural salubrity of the air and the great regard to cleanliness observed in every part of it _ Everywhere are hospitals established by bene-volent people for the reception of the poor and indigent; also asylums for those whose misfortunes or impru-dence may have brought to distress Ð yet the streets are so crowded with beggars, that a stranger at his first arrival would not imagine such ample provision was made for them, their fondness for liberty and aversion to restraint perhaps induce them to prefer this mode of subsisting. 
My friend showed me a partn brewery, a little after my first arrival in town, it operates on a very extensive scale; a steam engine is going that performs work, equal in power to twenty horses Ð the coppers in which the beer is brewed, and those in which it is cooled are in size like little ponds Ð in England they excel in this article, they therefore export great quantities of it Ð particularly to those countries, the climate</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="88">
        <p>of which is unfavorable to the cultivation of the vine: malt and beer contribute largely to the revenue. 
Another friend conducted me down the Thames. Some distance beyond the crowd of buildings, the country is there pleasant, but flat, and, were it not for the works of industry calculated to prevent it; would in many places be covered with water Ð however this natural imperfection has been turned to the advantage of commerce Ð by this means capacious docks have been formed, with much greater facility, than they could have been, had the land been high and dry Ð My friends particularly showed me the West India Docks, where a great number of ships can lay, and extensive warehouses are built so commodious, that their cargoes can be unladen, and stored immediately without further carriage. 
The next day I went with my friend to see a glass house, that is, the place where this transparent artich is manufactured, the ingredients and melted into a fluid and then run into the various shapes wanted, a great number of people are employed.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="89">
        <p>My time has been for the most part spent in attending to the many kind invitations of my worthy friends, and in viewing different parts of the town: of these I was most frequently with my friends the Mr Sandersons, Mr Smith, and in the country rarighwynyonten, and Mr Bevan Ð their hospitality and the general be-nevolence and rectitude of their dispositions will ever impress my mind with the strongest regard of friendship towards them Ð One day I was walking in company with the last mentioned gentleman, when I happened to mention that I had promised to return to Scotland before I should go to America again; but that as so much time had elapsed, I did not think I would do it  he replied if I had promised nothing should prevent the performing Ð I an-swered, that the reason, I did not think much of omitting the performance, was that I had only made it, with an interest to gratify my desire of seeing them again; and that as it would in-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="90">
        <p>comode me considerably to go that way, I thought the omission, as it would be disappointing myself rather than them, was of no consequence. He said no more; but I reflected on his saying &amp; determined in my mind he was right, we should never promise lightly, that which it is of no con-sequence to perform, and that which we promise do Ð otherwise we nourish falsehood Ð which is bad of itself, even where it has not a great tendency to wil consequences.
How much of excellent have I seen from the fortunate introduction, I have had into this city; whilst I have only had a distant glimpse of the vicious part Ð at the same time, that I observe every possible precaution in the power of the wise, and good taken to prevent the rise and check the progress of view. To punish the commission of crimes is no more than the effect of self preservation, and is the main point to which the laws of all communities are directed; but to endeavor to des-troy the evil propensities, from which this ori-ginates, and to trim the steps of youth from the path, which lead to guilt is an attempt worthy the dignity &amp; benevolence of a christian mind.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="91">
        <p>The greater part of the houses of private persons are of brick; but many of those of the nobility, as also many of the public buildings are of stone. The main streets are lined with the shops of tradesmen, and mechanics, in the former are exposed for sale every thing either the luxuries or the necessities of man require, the produce of this and every other country; in the latter those articles derived from their industry and in-genuity in their peculiar calling. You will na-turally imagine, the markets to supply with pro-visions such an enormous population must be abundant and so they are in reality Ð that of Smithfield, which is of considerable extent, is co-vered with cattle and animals for the butcherÕs stall, and when the industry practised in the cultivation of the surrounding country is considered that this market, and others, should find a sufficient and regular supply both of animal and vegetable food to distribute throughout so large, and populous a city, will not appear extraordinary; but how can we account for its being equally well supplied with fresh fish, which is a natural production of the sea, and not so absolutely under the control of man, in the depths of their watry element, impenetrable to his view.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="92">
        <p>I might have quit England ignorant of the source of this abundance, did not a seafaring gentleman acquaint me, that along the coast both to the North and West of the mouth of the Thames for upwards of two hundred miles there are fishermen that send fish to the London markets therefore every wind is favorable to one or the other, to keep the fish fresh, they are put into a vessel full of holes which towed after the craft. 
Thus we see in this instance self interest contributes to increase the comforts of life, and in many others it is turned to promote the common weal Ð The fisherman knowing that the wealthy citizen will pay well for his fish, takes the pains to convey it fresh to the market, where he receives its value in money, with which he may purchase the articles he stands in need of Ð the same principle actuates the merchant, the mechanic and the husbandman; and as a stimulus to industry is perfectly innocent Ð the man who wants a subsistance applies him-self to some branch of business, he fancies he is most expert at, what he derives from this, is wanted by many others Ð he therefore exchanges with them for the produces of their industry or</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="93">
        <p>for money, with which he can buy what he pleases. But when this sentiment too strong possesses the soul, it leads to the advancing our private interests at the expence of our fellow creatures, then it is criminal; because it is the parent of many crimes. To the breast of the chief or the warrior such a sentiment should be a stranger, the one should labor to promote the happiness of his nation, the other fight to defend it from insults and oppression, neither to gratify avarice or the vain ambition of a great name. I must conclude as I am just going to the country to my friend Rarighevyn-yanten

Dr Friend
From the time I last wrote to you I passed the time very agreeably among the friends I have already mentioned, except Shotsiciowane, who was gone to the sea coast; but I frequently saw his two sons two excellent young gentlemen; and had the pleasure to hear from them, he would soon be back Ð when I received an invitation from Shakodenre to dine with him on the 9th of last month Ð I there met my beloved friends Ichaka-enyo, and Roni-</p>

      <div type="page" n="94">
        <p>gonrowanen, the first meeting although my heart warmed towards them, I did not foresee, that they would have honored me with so great a portion of their friendship Ð Shakodenhre of whom I have already spoken, has a heart that ever glows with love to God, to his country and to man in general Ð his cousin Ichahaenyo, althoÕ at first appear-ance he seems to have a reserved exterior, yet when that is seen through, there is a soul possessed of every christian virtue, directed by a most superior understanding, in the exercise of them, opens to the view: Ronigonro-w?nen, to an extensive knowledge of mankind joins the sincerest piety and benevolence with a frankness truly delightful to those who enjoy the pleasure of his society.
In such company you may be sure I spent a happy afternoon, when Shakodenhre spoke, he gave both delight and instruction, the soft but animated words, which flow so easy from his lips, cannot fail to pene-trate the hearts of those who hear, with the</p>

      <div type="page" n="95">
        <p>sentiments that possess his own, the harmonious sounds seem yet to revibrate in my ears, and I hope will never cease to warm my heart Ð The next morning I returned to town; but before I quit the neighborhood called at the house of Ronigonrowanen, where he introduced me to his amiable lady &amp; family Ð these worthy gentle-men inhabit a beautiful situation about five miles from London, of which althoÕ the beauties of inanimate nature are by no means in-considerable, yet in my estimation, it is not so much to be admired on that account as it is for the beauties which decorate the minds of many of the inhabitants. 
On my arrival in town I find a letter from our noble friend Thorighway?re, which breath the kindest language, and warm desire to serve you Ð in two days I have another invitation from Shakodenhre to dine, and spend a few days with him, which from the sample I already had you may be assured gave me inexpressible satisfaction; this time I had the pleasure of meeting there again Ronigonrowanen, and</p>

      <div type="page" n="96">
        <p>four other gentlemen, I had not seen before, how-ever the politeness and affability so natural to them soon made me feel as easy, as if we had been long acquainted Ð the conversation turned generally upon the character of different tribes, and this I gave as it is among those yet uncontaminated by their civilized neighbors, thinking it needless to recapitulate the same vices, which are common to the depraved and lower classes of people in civilized society, and which have also been too much introduced, among these tribes, which remain in or near to the European settlements. 
Two of these gentlemen particularly friendship seemed more quickly to cement our hearts the one Iharihowanen a worthy gentleman, who lived a few miles of the other Rorighwawa-go, who lived in the same neighborhood Ð In the afternoon we walked through the plea-sure grounds to the house of Ichakaenyo, which is delightfully ornamented with fine shady trees, and a beautiful greens the verdancy and neatness of which seems to be increased by its being cut every</p>

I was here introduced to the family of Ichaka-enyo, his lady seemed to have a kindred soul with himself, as that of Shakodenhre resembled him Ð designed to render each other happy, through the sojour of life, and shower blessings on all around them. 
The Sunday I passed with Shakodenhre and his pious family with pleasure and comfort, their example seemed to elevate my mind to higher thoughts Ð The silent piety of my friends in town is highly exemplary, and pleasing; but however profitable it may be to themselves in the eyes of him, who sees the heart and knows the thoughts of it; pious eloquence seems to scatter around, for the good of all, the blessings of a religious disposition.</p>

        <p>On Monday morning I take farewell of my worthy friend, to go on a visit to Onondio, and call on Karihaw?nen which was on my way there, as I had promised, when we parted. After walking a few miles on a pleasant road, with country seats, and villages on each of it Ð I arrived at the village, opposite to that, where my friend lives, (either of them however might pass for towns of consideration in America,) I crossed the Thames on a wooden bridge, I think it is three hundred yards over; here this River has a beautiful appearance, the banks at each side covered with delightful Villas, gardens and pleasure grounds Nature and Art seem to vie, which should most excite the admiration of the beholder, and contribute most to beau-tify the banks of so noble a stream. I arrived at my friendÕs, and he introduced me to his worthy lady and charming little ones. he immediately requested me to stop dinner, and in the meantime took me out</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="99">
        <p>to see the church, and the BishopÕs grounds; the former is an ancient building of what is called the Gothic taste, in which there is more grandeur than beauty; the latter are very pleasantly laid out along the banks of the river Ð after indulging the eyes with this view, we walked to see a beautiful Villa ornamented in a most elegant manner, and then returned to dinner; my worthy friend then introduced me to the young gentlemen he had under his care Ð and very easily prevailed on me to pass the evening with them Ð After dinner we took a pleasant excursion in a barge on the River, and in the evening we saw a great member of the ladies, and gentlemen of place there, and the time passed pleasantly in sprightly conversation some-times enlivened by music; similar to which you have heard. In the morning I proceeded to the abode of Onondio, my friend accompanying me some distance on the other side the River. At Richmond I</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="100">
        <p>again crossed the Thames; here the River passes through a most delightful country; but its stream has much diminished in width at this place from what it is where I last recrossed it, it not being more than fifty or sixty yards over Ð Richmond park, through which the foot path leads, is a charming situation, on going out of it, I pass through a Village and then over some commons, till I arrive at the enclosed fields, near our friends house Ð that which is called commons here, are tracts of uninclosed land, which the inhabitants of a certain district have an equal right to &amp; on which they turn their cattle Ð experience has shown, that these lands become much more productive, when divided and changed into private property, to effect a division, I believe an act of Parliament is necessary Ð and this has taken place in many parts, where there is a probability of fertilizing the land by industry. 
I remain but one day, and return to my friendÕs Shakodenhre, yet early in the morning, that day I met several worthy gen-tlemen, at his house; they were deliberating on the means to send and support Christian</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="101">
        <p>teachers in our country; they asked me what part of the scriptures had been translated into the Mohawk language, which I told them. and then it was pro-posed that I should further translate the Gospel of St. John; this I readily agreed to, and immedi-ately made a commencement.
I then go to the house of Ronigourow?-nen, as I had before promised; and there pass two days in his company, from which I derived both pleasure and instruction Ð (in the mean time, I have the happiness to see again my dear friend Shotsiciowane return from the sea coast, it was through his means, God was pleased, I should be introduced to the excellent and pleasing society I now enjoy.) the morning is generally spent in study, which gives me a good opportunity to translate, the afternoon in conversation or taking a walk, and the evening in reading some excellent book and making remarks on it. 
On his inquiring the manner in which we subsist in America, I replied, that the only method pursued by the Aboriginal tribes to supply their wants, was hunting, fishing</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="102">
        <p>and the cultivation of maire, some were more ingenious than others in building houses, or canoes making gun stocks or wooden bowls; but not so much so, as to confine themselves to that spe-cies of labor, or to merit the appellation of arti-ficers Ð he observed, that the diversity of ranks, and occupations in civilized nations, composed as it were different links, which mutually supported each other Ð The Merchant and mechanic, imported or manufactured the articles of use or luxury wanted by the rich, and with the money he received from those was enabled to employ the laboring poor to forward his plans of commerce or industry; The farmer supports the whole with food, which he raises of the land, and out of the money he receives for its produce, he pays the owner of the land, which he again spends in gratifying his taste or his luxury Ð This all live dependent on each other; and money, so much sought for, does no more than cause this mutual dependence, to be less perceptible to the common observer, and to exist with less inconvenience to the various parties concerned. Therefore in a community where this mineral is rare, any other metal or substitute might answer as well, for the substantial wealth of any people is the produce of its territory and industry.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="103">
        <p>From the house of this noble friends I go to dine with Ichakaenyo, there I met two young gentlemen of extraordinary talents Ð The conversation turned principally upon America and character of the abor-iginal natives; in which, I followed the same rule I had done before, that is, confine myself prin-cipally to the description of these tribes least con-taminated. In the afternoon, after having taken a pleasant walk in the lawn, we returned to the drawing room, and during some part of the evening Ð Dr RobertsonÕs history of America was taken up, and some passages read, describing the peculiar indolence of the Aborigines, among other things, it mentions, that labor advances so slowly under their hands, that it frequently happens, that a house which is building rots in the foundation before the roof is compleat, and that a canoe is in decay at the part begun before the other part is finished. When they asked me of the truth of this, I could not avoid ex-pressing my surprise, that a historian so justly celebrated for his writings, should suffer himself to be so far misled by the ill natured descriptions of travellers, as to give so incon-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="104">
        <p>sistent an account to the world, for it is evident that if this was really the case, that neither canoes or houses would ever be built Ð with the Five Nations the best houses of that kind generally in use, are built by a man, with a little assistance of his family, to carry the pieces of timber it is composed of, and the bark for the roof, in a month sometimes two but perhaps never more than three, that is between the time of planting and of getting in the corn Ð inferior kinds of houses, for a temporary abode, are only the labor of a day or two Ð As to canoes the elm bark is made into one in a day, may perform a journey of seventy leagues in a week and in two weeks more if exposed to the weather will be rotten Ð The wooden canoe or pirogue, which is of that kind used by the people to the Southward, is only the labor of two or three days, and as they are seldom made but when wanted for immediate use are generally finished with expedition Ð The birch bark canoe in use with the Northern tribes are</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="105">
        <p>durable and finished neatly, yet it does not ap-pear, the builders are usually very long time in the fabrication. 
I cannot allow indolence to be a peculiar characteristic of the native of America, the man that will run in pursuit of a bear or a buffalo all day, dance all night, exert every nerve to come of victor in playing at ball, in the plain before the village exposed to the burning rays of the sun, or that will march two hundred leagues through a desert to fight an enemy, cannot with propriety be called indolent. 
That they have an aversion to labor must be admitted; but not that this characteristic is peculiar to them alone Ð this is a trait that appears conspicuous in the character of man, wherever he is found, whether it be in the commercial city or the uncultivated wilderness, he is fond of action, but averse to labor Ð it is this principle actuaty the barbarian to make war to obtain slaves, and the civilized man to buy them Ð it renders the citizen ardent to accumu-</p>

      <div type="page" n="106">
        <p>late wealth or acquire some liberal profession, that he may command the labor of others; and live exempt from it himself. 
In a country crowded with inhabitants as Europe is at present, where the lower class depend for a subsistence on the employ or bounty of the rich, to possess money is to be exempt from labor Ð but among rude and simple tribes, that occupy a great extent of country, and where men are nearly equal Ð Money where there is any has not these advantages to the same extent Ð For there a man has it at his option to work for another man and buy his necessaries with his wages, or to cultivate his own land, and sustain himself with its produce Ð This is the cause and origin of slavery, that unjust degradation of the human species; for men could not then obtain those of the same community, or at least in sufficient number, to perform menial services for them, they therefore reduced fo-reigners taken in war to this state of subjection.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="107">
        <p>You will say perhaps that our ancestors although cruel, and fond of war were yet never so unjust as to reduce to a state of slavery their vanquished enemies; but generously received them, as adopted members of the community: and that observation is true in fact, yet if we give this a fair consideration, our vanity will have no great reason to exult Ð in the first place we must observe, that the same temptation did not exist with them, as in the Eastern world; throughout our continent the Great Spirit was pleased, to grant for the sustenance of man, only such ani-mals as run wild in the forest; the only means by which benefit could be derived from these was by the chace Ð now to think to make a slave of a man, you have no other way to employ, but in hunting would be a folly Ð for if he is a hunter he can leave you when he pleases Ð besides as cattle fa-cilitate labor, so they render more of it neces-sary, where no luxurious taste for building prevails, the labor requisite to raise a suffi-ciency of corn for the subsistence of a fa-mily and from fertile land is very small.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="108">
        <p>In the Eastern Hemisphere from the first times domestic animals have abounded, these became subservient to main in tillage, carriage and to his subsistence, and at the same time that they enabled him to cultivate the ground with more ease, rendered it necessary for him to cultivate it to a greater extent, than if he had been alone Ð As the ambition and desires of man rise with this gratification, he finding himself in possession of dominion over herds of domestic animals, craved further to have in subjec-tion under him his fellow creatures, that he might employ them in attending his flocks or cultivating the ground Ð to gratify this desire he might be constrained to excite his tribe to join in some enterprize against their neighbors, and thus obtain slaves by force, or else purchase them of those, who had already acquired them by their arms Ð For some ages they remained content with having slaves to guard their flocks and cultivate their grounds; but frequently it so happened, that the nation which at one time made slaves, in their</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="109">
        <p>tum became the property of some more power-ful conqueror, some of these by a continued series of successes arrived at that degree of emi-nence and security, as enabled them to culti-vate the arts of luxury and taste, then they found it necessary to have slaves to attend upon their persons, and as in nations unfavored with the guidance of GodÕs holy religion, corrup-tion seems too often to follow the increase of wealth and dominion Ð they at least had slaves to administer to their vices Ð and at the present day, they have them made eun-uchs for the purpose of watching their wives, in the Eastern countries, where the Mahometan religion prevails.
Thanks to the principles of Christianity there is no more slavery in Christendom, that is in the litteral sense of the word; those who want assistance to work or servants to attend on them must hire, and the servant may sometimes choose as well as the master Ð Religion has rescued the slave in Europe ages since, I hope it may please God that its benign influence may soon free them</p>

      <div type="page" n="110">
        <p>in every other part, for there is no passage of scripture expresses, that a black skin is to be the mark to denote a man designed for a slave. AlthoÕ temptation be no palliation for guilt, yet I have related these circumstances to show, that you have no just reason to boast, that this depravation never prevailed in our parts, because perhaps had the same inducement existed they might have fallen into the same error. 
What I have now said may also serve to demonstrate to you, that the little indus-trious labor performed by Americans in com-parison to the persevering exertions of Euro-peans is not so much to be attributed to any material difference in the temperament of their bodies, as to the diversity of circum-stances attending their respective situa-tions.
After a pleasant but serious conversa-tion of a few hours, Ichakaenyo called all his household and after reading and explaining a part of the scripture said prayers, this is the regular custom of the worthy gentle-men in this neighborhood Ð I returned home in this morning &amp; again set off for the country 
Adieu
(p.112[DR13]) London October 5, 1804
Dr Friend
After I last wrote I parted with much regret from my friend Shakodenhre, he left his house near London to go to his country seat Ð on my way to town I call on Shotsiciowa-ne, he very kindly inquires into the state of my circumstances and generously offers me assistance he appoints a certain day for me to go with him to his uncleÕs Ð and in the interim I pay another visit to Onondio, and passed several days very pleasantly with him; since my find acquaintance with this gentleman, I received from him such marks of friendship, as left no doubt of their sincerity Ð I was in hopes to have heard through him from Canada; but in that respect I was always disappointed Ð
I returned home a little before the time appointed, and had not been long there, when my worthy friend Shotsiciowane called, and I went with him to Wathamstow, he there introduced me to his excellent uncle Ð this venerable gentle-man could not fail to strike the beholder with respect and reverence, he is now past his seven-tieth year, althoÕ he suffers from the natural (p.111[DR14]) infirmities of age, increased by an unfortunate sprain in the shoulder, yet is his mind vigorous, and is coun tenance strongly impresses you with the idea of his having spent a life of piety towards God and of benevolence to man Ð I get home again that evening, and find my dear Rakehedenro is return Ð from the west Ð it gave me particular satisfaction to see him again in health and gratified by his journey, the evening we spent very plea-santly together, indeed the whole of my time I pass much to my satisfaction and instruction, constantly benefiting by the instructive conversation, I enjoy with the worthy characters I have had the happiness to fall among Ð the mornings, and other times I have been employÕd in translating Gospel of St John Ð which having concluded the British foreign Bible Society with their wonted benevolence, and generosity have undertook to print it for the use of the Mo-hawks. 
Last month I had almost determined to return; but I have now taken a contrary resolution, from several circumstances Ð one my attend-ance will be requisite to correct the press,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="113">
        <p>the other that appearances seemed to indicate, as if an invasion might be attempted, you may therefore imagine, that while in America I wished to risk in the fate of this country, that now after the kindness I have received, gratitude would strengthen the desire Ð I am not so vain, as to imagine that my service can be of much weight among some hundred thousands brave fellows, ardent in defence of their King, their country and every thing dear to their hearts; but to share their fate will be gratifying an inclination of the Soul, that I cannot wish to smother. 
The attempt will be dangerous to the enemy in the highest degree, unless he should have a perfect calm to cross the Channel, the ships of war, may sink more than half of his boats before they can reach the shore Ð and should they land, they will get such a reception, as they have not been accustomed to meet in the other countries of Europe, that they invaded. 
There they were accustomed to contend with a band of mercenaries reduced to a mere piece of machinery, which when broken or disjointed becomes useless; but there they will meet soldiers, animated by the af-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="114">
        <p>fection they bear their King and country to emulate the glorious achievements of their ancestors Ð the volunteers composed of the gentlemen, and yeomanry of the country with the citizens of the towns, have become nearly as expert in military exercise, as the regu-lar troops, these, having everything to contend for ca-pable to incite valor, will without a doubt equal the most heroic deeds ever performed in warlike contest, not only a faithful attachment to a beloved sovereign and equitable laws; but the recollection that it is also for their parents, their wives their children and friends, that they fight, will excite them to scorn life without victory Ð and resigning their fate to the disposal of him, who ever favors the just cause, cheerfully rush into the arms of death to preserve the political existence of their country. 
The Ministry have encouraged the Volunteer system and seem principally to rely on it, for the internal defence of the Kingdom, which, like every thing else they do for the good of the country, whether it be well or ill planned, is much disapproved by those in the opposition, I have heard many arguments on the subject, but after all I must retain the opinion, that the most rational defence of a nation of freemen,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="115">
        <p>is the men themselves Ð and I can find no reason why a gentleman or yeoman of the country, who has devoted so much of his attention to the military exercise, as to be able to perform the necessary evolutions without confusion, may not be as good a soldier, and fight as well for his country, in which he has an interest himself, as the man that has been subsisting on a scanty stipend and performing at field days for several years, who has no motive to rouse his natural valor, unless he may be fired with a spark of that disinterested patriotism which appears so generally diffused throughout the British Island Ð If it is alleged that the citizen is effimi-nate, it must also be recollected, that recruits are taken from the cities to supply the army Ð thus it must be acknowledged, that the ingredients of which the volunteers are composed, are in no ways inferior to the regulars Ð and should these latter have seen some service I do not apprehend why that should give any great superiority to the common soldier, where the tactics are so well understood, although it might give experience to the general.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="116">
        <p>On taking restrospect of ancient times we may see Rome rise to the summit of power without a standing army, and fall when she had in her pay numbers of mercenary legions Ð the Greeks never performed greater feats than when a soldier, and a citizen were synonimous terms. 
The British regular troops are with reason supposed to be equal, if not superior to any in the world Ð yet they labor under many disadvantages Ð in the first place a too great in-dulgence is given to luxury among the officers; which the pay of a young subaltern is unable to support; and which obliges him to squander too much of the time, he should dedicate to the study of his profession. 2 then throughout the British Kingdoms, the army is not res-pected, so that few enlist as soldiers, unless the un-fortunate or the lowest class of the people. Thus men, however, disinterested, or patriotic will feel a repugnance to enlist for soldiers, when they know, that they then will be classed, with men of such principles, and conversation, as they never would have asoci-ated with in a state of freedom.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="117">
        <p>3rd The little hopes of preferment given to a common soldier, checks the ambition, that might incite him to improve in his profession; and the state of inactivity in which they remain during a peace, leads him too often into scenes of debauchery and vice, that enfeeble his body and corrupt his mind.
From the consideration of these circumstances, I am therefore convinced, that the superiority of the British troops, is more likely to be derived from the National Spirit, which pervades all ranks than from any thing else Ð and I can perceive no cause to prevent this Spirit influencing the volunteers, as much as the regulars.
I hope that, while there is so much cause of apprehension as there exists at present, from the over grown power, and apparent evil designs of France, the Volunteer system may not be abolished, but that its discipline may be kept up and improved Ð I think all circumstances considered, the increasing the military force of regulars, to any great degree on the pre-sent establishment is not so adviseable as to make a small addition on an improved</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="118">
        <p>plan; which might be attempted in this man-ner, a legion to be raised in which none should be admitted but such as could bring proofs of an unexceptionable character, which should be required of all that enlisted Ð the term of enlist-ment five years Ð none to be a commissioned officer until he had served in the corps three years in the ranks Ð the first officers to be chosen by the legions, either from the regulars, the volunteers or from among them-selves, these to be approved of, and confirmed by His Majesty or the commander in Chief Ð The soldierÕs pay should be sufficient to provide an abundant and healthy diet Ð their clothing should be furnished Ð the pay of the officers need be no more than it is now in the army Ð for in the camp glory not luxury should be the object.
Thus you see the materials of which I would have the legion composed; because I think a nation should principally confide its defence Ð and the advancement of its military glory</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="119">
        <p>to that class of citizens, who are most likely to be interested in its preservation and prosperity: besides as this legion should always be kept in motion, it would be a fine field of amusement for young gentlemen, that had nothing to do, at the same time that it would be keeping them out of mischief, it might also become an ex-cellent seminary for officers. I shall now proceed to show you the manner I would have it to form and to be brought into action, the present method striking me as more calculated for a parade than a battle Ð a battallion of five hundred or a thousand men formed two or three deep, if they charge with any degree of rapidity must inevitably break their ranks before they reach the enemy; but if they even preserve good order, what solidity can be expected from such an extended shallow line Ð Should they charge in column riflemen and cannon may make great destruction among them.
The Legion commanded by a general should consist of six battalions, and each battalion of twelve hundred men under the command of a colonel, eight hundred men should compose the main body of the heavy armed infantry;</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="120">
        <p>divided into four companies, each consisting og two hundred including twenty file leaders Ð a company to have a Captain, two lieuten-ants, a standard bearer and four serjeants. These companies to be armed with rifles capa-ble of doing execution at a great distance and spears for the charge: a pistol might be added to the file leader. 
Two hundred of the most active are to be divided into two companies of a hundred each including ten file leaders Ð the company to have a Captain, lieutenant &amp; two serjeants, the officers to have plumes to their caps for the men to rally by in lieu of having a standard. they are to be armed with rifles, and short swords, and called the light infantry. The other two hundred are to compose two companies of horse Ð each having a Cap-tain, Lieutenant, Cornet and two serjeants. The men are all to have light rifles slung over the shoulder to use in situations where they might be constrained to act on foot; but when mounted always to place their dependence on the sword and pike. I have omitted music, however, drums and fifes may be given the heavy armed, and trum-peters to the others</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="121">
        <p>In forming the Legion the battalion that takes the right should enjoy a pre-eminence ei-ther from the seniority skill or courage of the officers and soldiers; the next in rank to take the left Ð and the next two to be stationed in the centre on each side the legionary standard Ð the inferior battalions, being on the right and left between the flank and center battalions. 
The Legion to form for a charge where no peculiar advantage is to be derived from the ground, may leave an interval of twenty or thirty paces between each battalion and of ten or twenty between each company, these forming five deep or ten if necessary Ð the Captain in the centre and a lieutenant with two sergeants on each flank. 
The light infantry are to advance in front of the battalion one company on the right, the other on the left flank Ð they are to divide in files of ten men each, when they are within two hundred yards of the enemy to commence firing; the two leading men of the file, to fire and then retire in the rear to load, the next following to do the same until the whole have fired Ð by this means an unremitting fire will</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="122">
        <p>be kept up on the enemy much to his annoyance, when the two lines draw nigh to each other, they retire between the intervals, and through them continue their fire during the charge, or if wanted to add to its weight they may close files and join the heavy infantry these as soon as the light infantry have retired from their front are to rush to the charge with the greatest impetuosity and order. 
The cavalry are to form in rear of their respective battalions, a company on the right and another on the left flank Ð and there to wait in readiness, either to advance through the intervals, jointly with the light infantry, should the enemy be broken, to prevent by a furious attacks his rallying again Ð or should their own line be broken, to stop the career of the enemy until it can form again. 
At other times when the Legionary General may see advantages to be gained by taking situations, he can dispatch in a body, the cavalry, and light infantry the oldest Captain taking the command Ð All must be practised in shooting at a mark until they are perfectly expert riflemen.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="123">
        <p>The reason for giving the pre-eminence to the flanks, is that they are more exposed to be pressed upon by the enemy than the center, and for so closely connecting the light infantry and cavalry with the main body is that generally in most situations they require the support of each other Ð where there is no natural interruption to prevent coming to a charge, the heavy infantry should not delay to fire; but advance under the cover of the light infantry Ð the deep ranks of the companies will give a greater solidity and weight Ð the intervals between them, and the battalions, will enable the general to extend his line without weakening his ranks, and prevent the line breaking so easily, as otherwise it might, whenever it would be necessary to advance with quickness Ð each company having a particular standard, should they break at any time the men can form with facility on rallying, by reason of the small distance from the centre to the flanks of the company.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="124">
        <p>The Light infantry are to be expert marksmen, and are to form in files of ten deep, with two paces interval between the files, they are to fire by two in rotation, as already mentioned; which will send an uninterrupted shower of bullets to meet the enemy either in advancing or retreating this method will do away the necessity of platoon firing, for should one file be more expeditious in loading and discharging, the others have only to drop by them to keep the line. Should the enemyÕs cavalry notwithstanding their incessant fire, yet attempt to charge them, they can close files, and be ready to receive them in compact order. 
The principal distinction of the light Infantry should consist in the celerity of their movements, every evolution should be performed in running, observing the greatest regularity, which is no less essential to them than the other troops; for if irregulars have sometimes severely annoyed armies, it has been by means</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="125">
        <p>of their courage activity and dexterity in the use of their weapons, not by their irregularity or want of discipline, which must always be a disadvantage. When the situation might render it more advantageous to annoy the enemy with the fire of the main body, than to advance immediately to the charge, they can pursue the same method observed by the light infantry resting their rifles on their spears stuck in the ground to take more steady aim. These al-though more heavy than the Light Infantry should yet be accustomed to more briskly, al-ways in a quick pace Ð for there may occur situations in which celerity in movements, may be employed to obtain advantages, which otherwise would have been lost from de-ficiency in numbers.
Connoisseurs in the Military art will probably condemn this the outlines of my plan as a novelty without hearing any reason in its defence Ð to this I will answer Ð that it will however be giving the opportunity to every man of Spirit to serve his King and country, in the capacity of a gentleman soldier, until his abilities or service should obtain a commission for him,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="126">
        <p>And if on making the attempt, it did not receive due encouragement from the class of people intended to compose it, the whole of course would fall to the ground. As to the method of forming, and acting to give you all the reasons I could advance in its support would take up too much time at present. I shall therefore only state, that as it appears to me the main object aimed at by discipline is to enable a body of men to unite their forces in such a manner, as to be able, without confusion, to act collectively against the enemy; so the best method to be taken to effect this is that, in which, the individual force of the mem-bers who compose the body, is in no manner, restrained or weakened, but only lead, to act conjointly, to give and to receive sup-port, and to be in readiness to fall with their united strength, on the point to which they may be directed by their commander, the less complicate the various manoeuvres, the more expeditiously they will be performed in the hurry and confusion of a battle Ð for firing or standing a charge a different order of battle is necessary Ð this is obtained by admitting of or closing the intervals between the files, which is performed by a few steps taken to the right or left.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="127">
        <p>Thus my dear friend do we occupy ourselves in forming mighty plans in policy and war, and in some this is a natural propensity, furnishing no inconsiderate degree of amusement, yet we may rest assured, that that only takes place, which is allowed of, and permitted by the Great Spirit Ð and it is on his aid and protection, I rely for the final suc-cess of this nation in the present contest, more than on all the plans that may be devised by the wisdom or executed by the strength of man Ð There are too many good people here, who call upon his name, for me to suppose for a moment, that he would permit them together with our virtuous and beloved Sovereign to fall prostate before a people, who a few years ago suppressed all religion within the limits of their power Ð but should they even make good their landing, I hope He will inspire with the courage of their ancient heroes, every Bri-tish warrior, and that trusting in him, they may seize the victory, burying the glory of ambitious France under heaps of her slaughtered soldiery.

This last month I have passed very pleasantly with my friends Ronigonrow?nen, Ichakaenyo, Shotsiciawane, Ronjhwawago and Ihanchowanen from all of whom IÕve received the sincerest tokens of regard both for my temporal and ever-lasting happiness Ð The Sundays I am frequently with the latter, when I hear him with the fervor of piety and powers of eloquence, ex-plain the holy writings, the witness of our faith. 
The other gentlemen live in the same neighborhood; so that when I am there, few days pass, but what I have the pleasure of seeing the most of them, the manners of the whole are strongly characterised by piety, and a strict adherence to virtue Ð with them I enjoy a conversation both pleasing, and in-structive, read the finest books, and join in prayers to the author of our being, and in fine weather walk for exercise, and amusement in the pleasantest lawns, and groves, I seem to have a paradise below.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="129">
        <p>While I am at the house of Ronigonrow?nen a worthy friend Ronigonrio, called and took me to their country seat at M_ which is a delightful situation, even at this season of the year; but however its beauty may exceed the des-cription of words; it is much surpassed by the amiable disposition of its inhabitants Ð I re-mained here a few days, when I returned with my friend, and passed the evening with him in town in company with some gentlemen of his acquaintance. 
The next day I return to C_ and dine at Rorighwak?ro, and remain the ensuing day there Ð when I return to town I am invited by the brother of his lady; two days after, there I meet a gentleman from America, who had almost lost his eye sight in the evening my friend Ronigonrio calls for me, and takes me to the house of Sha-kodenhre, in town, who had not yet arrived, to meet a gentleman eminent for his piety extensive knowledge and learning.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="130">
        <p>This excellent man whom I shall distin-guish by the name of Rorighwanon; received us in the most pleasing manner, piety, philan-thropy benevolence and frankness are very conspicuous traits in his countenance Ð After inquiring very minutely of our manners and customs he observed, Yes, I see you have plenty of occupations to exercise the body; but few, too few, wherewith to exercise the mind the most valuable part of man.
We took farewell of this worthy gen-tleman, and I returned home. After remaining there one day, I go to my friend Shotsiciowane, and from there to Ichaka-enyo, where I meet his brother, who lives about thirty miles from town Ð there I also meet a Chinese, who had come from China to learn English, but withstanding his long voyage during which he heard that language he could hardly express a clear idea in it Ð his countenance is mild; but very singular featured Ð his complexion much like a pure blooded aborigine of America only rather more pale, perhaps from not being</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="131">
        <p>so much exposed to the air in a severe climate, his dress is long robes of silk, lined with fur; silken boots with soals an inch thick, he wears on his head, a cap that tapers to a point, his hair is shaved, except a small spot on the crown of his head, this is plaited, and reaches almost to his heels. 
The British Government not succeeding by treaty in preventing the Spaniards from giving pecuniary assis-tance to the French, ordered three frigates to be dispatched to make seizure of some Spanish ships, that were coming from South America laden with bullion, the British frigates overtaking them, requested the Commander to surrender, which on his refusing, an engagement commenced, one of the Spanish ships blew up, and the remaining two struck their colours Ð it is intended to restore the property providing the Spanish Government gives sufficient secu-rity, that they will in no manner aid the French: from every appearance, however, there is every likelihood of a war com-mencing with this nation.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="132">
        <p>I need not weary you with repetitions where I am today or tomorrow, as it is princi-pally or entirely among the excellent people I have already mentioned, towards whom every day, I feel an increase of friendship, as I perceive fresh in-stances of their worth, their active and exten-sive benevolence. Tomorrow the nephew of Ichakaenyo is to call for me, where I now am at the house of Ronigonrow?nen to take me to the country to his FatherÕs 
Adieu

My Dr Friend
In the morning after I last wrote, I went with the young gentleman, whom I shall distinguish by the name of Ranigonraghsnore and another gentleman. A little before dinner we arrived at the seat, which is surrounded by a beautiful park, some of which resembles our own oak woods; but I could only now imagine, what it was in the blooming seasons of the year, for at present, the beauties of the field and the forest had faded away. There remained now only the whistling of the</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="133">
        <p>winds among the lofty tops of the trees, to call the attentions Ð There was a very worthy clergy-man there from the neighborhood, I have so often mentioned, who preached us a good sermon next day, being Sunday, in the Chapel Ð which is a plain building pa-tern of ancient times Ð on observing the tomb stones and conversing on the subject, I learnt that, there are few people now living in the place, that are descended from its ancient inhabitants Ð this gave me an idea, that pro-bably commerce may cause, in the neighbor-hood of great cities, the population to fluc-tuate, the country people selling out &amp; ven-turing in trade in hopes of becoming richer, the rich inhabitants of cities buying estates in the country, tired of the bustle of a town, to enjoy the pleasures of rural life.
I enjoyed particular satisfaction in the conversation of my young worthy friend, his mind is active and penetrating, &amp; his ideas lively Ð All the family join a lively and cheerful temperament, to a pious depart-ment</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="134">
        <p>The other gentleman our companion had resi-did in Russia many years; and if I gratified them with accounts of America, I was amply repaid by his relation of Russian affairs; this very ex-tensive Empire, which Peter the Great raised to the rank of a civilized nation, yet appears to retain many traits of barbarism Ð the greater part of it is situate in the Northern part of the temperate zone, which is adapted to cultivation much farther north there, than it is in our Hemisphere Ð St. Petersburg is in Latitude 60 degrees that is seventeen degrees to the north of us, yet the climate does not appear to be much more severe than ours, perhaps it may be more steady, Archangel which I am told, is yet some degrees farther north situate on the White sea, is inhabited by a fine race of men, and produces, as fine cattle, as are to be found in any part of the country Ð the climate, as nigh as I can learn is similar to Quebec. 
The Peasantry of Russia are held in a state of bondage by the great men, and apparently Justice must be very feeble there, and the court very corrupt, for they very</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="135">
        <p>often assassinate their Emperors. Their troops are numerous, perhaps two or three hun-dred thousand, and are said to be equal for passive valor to any; but the general-ity of their inferior officers, more ignorant of their profession, than those of many other European nations. 
These gentlemen carry on a very extensive trade with that country Ð The im-ports from there, are I believe, principally hemp, wax and honey Ð
Our companion return to town, and my friend Ranejonraghsnore, proposes going a fowling, altho it is rather two late in the season here, for to find much sport Ð We set out early in the morning with the Game keeper, the object of our sport were hares, pheasants and partridges Ð the first two bear a resemblance to ours only the pheasants are much more handsome, the latter are like our quails but larger, we went over several heaths, passed some farms for several mile round Ð the game keeper knowing generally near about where the game keeps, there he</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="136">
        <p>led us. We called at a small farmhouse, which as it was the first, I was in during my abode in England, I cannot omit observing, that the neat-ness, and cleanliness, conspicuous in the cottage together with the decent appearance, and honest simplicity of the good landlady, gave me a very favorable opinion of this class of people, and cause me to regret, that their numbers in this country are not greater: should the great landholders cur-tail some of their unnecessary expenses, that they might encourage such farmers on their lands, by lightening their rents or by any other means bene-volence might direct Ð they certainly would ac-quire to themselves a luxury superior to any that is to be bought for money, and at the same time add to the natural strength of the nation by favoring the increase of a hardy and in-dustrious peasantry. In the afternoon we returned time enough to get ready to go and dine at a neighboring gentlemanÕs who was a keen sportsman, at the same time a very accomplished gentleman Ð he had travelled through many countries of Europe Ð and the</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="137">
        <p>conversation principally turned on these subjects. Our friend proposed shooting at a mark the next morning with a fine Tyrrol rifle. 
The next day we set off with our guns, expecting to find some sport on the way to Guild-ford, where I was to take coach; we called at our friendÕs, who was waiting for us, and we went to a neighboring wood on the side of the hill to shoot. Ð The rifle was very compleatly finished, but whether it was the shortness, or the manner of fixing the sights or the make of the stock, I could not take aim so readily, as with those we have &amp; therefore did not shoot with any degree of certainty. We parted and proceeded over some heaths to Guildford, where I got into the coach, parted with my friend &amp; proceeded to London, when I arrived that evening Ð the drivers in this country have not so much to say, as that kind of men in America, unless it was when I asked some question, which he always answered in a civil respectful manner, a word never passed all the road to London, which I believe is about thirty miles.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="138">
        <p>I arrived at Charing Cross, a little after dark, and hastened home, there I passed the evening with my friend, whose company, I had not often the pleasure of enjoying, since my extensive acquain-tance called me so much from home. 
In the morning I called on Shakorharat-steani, and at several other places Ð my friend Shotsiciowane proposed the next day to take me to see Ratsinowatisahs Ð he received us very cordially, and invited us to pass the Sunday evening with him, when a number of his friends would be there.
My friend took me home with him, and at the day appointed, we dined together at his sonÕs Shakoyanenhawe, and in the evening went to the house of the gentleman mentioned which we found full of philosophers Ð among many who engaged our attention, was Col. G_ who entered into conversation with the greatest politeness, and expressed desire of further acquaintance Ð here I had an in-vitation from a gentleman who I was told possessed half a million; but by reason of an other previous engagement I could not accept it.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="139">
        <p>A short time after this my friend I. introduced me to the B. of 	a man of great piety and learning, after a while the conversation turned on religion, and the sending a missionary to you he asked me particularly, if you had impowered me to seek on, I replied no, but that I was sensi-ble, a missionary would be received with great satisfaction among the Mohawks, it being now a hundred years since they were first converted to profess the Christian Faith. We took farewells without any thing being determined on the subject; only that my friend was to make some enquiry of the secretary of the Missionary Society. 
This subject led me into reveries and reflections on the great generosity of the Kind, and yet, that this thing needful should be o-mitted. Should our lands be confirmed, we might ourselves appropriate a part of them, for the support of a mis-sionary and teachers.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="140">
        <p>I returned to C_ m to the house of my beloved Ichaka-enyo, and there passed several days with the usual degree of pleasure and delight with him, and my other excellent acquaintance in that place. The Christian benevolence, and humanity of these worthy people are conspicu-ous in the extensive charitable institutions they support for the relief and instruction of the poor. On the coast of Africa they have, in conjunction with many other good people, caused an esta-blishment to be made, for the express purpose of opening a trade with the natives for the natural produce of the country, thereby to incite industry, and diminish the shocking propensity of these people to traffic in their species. 
I was several days with my worthy friend Shotsiciowane, and his amiable family previous to their departure for Bath, on taking farewell, I promised, that should I leave England before their return, I would pass that way. 
From my first acquaintance with these excellent people, every day seemed to bring an increase of affection, proceeding from the grati-tude, their kindness, their candour and sincerity could not fail to excite.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="141">
        <p>Shakoyanenharve took me to call on Col. G_ we mistake his residence and call upon his brother, also Col. G afterwards, however, we find him; our blunder notwithstand-ing had a pleasant consequence, for we were thereby introduced to both brothers, and were no less gratified by the acquaintance of one than the other. 
In this time I receive pressing invitations from my worthy friend at Bath Ð and have an invitation to dine at the house of my excellent friend Ichaka-enyo with the Spanish Admiral Don Juan de Bus-tamento, and the second in command, who were lately taken Ð I could not obtain much informa-tion from them, respecting the countries they had been in, perhaps policy might render them less communicative than otherwise they would have been. I learnt however that in the Spanish colonies many of the ancient natives had acquired knowledge of the mechanical and laborious arts. In the different provinces of the Viceroyship of Mexico, that there is seven millions of inhabitants, the greater part of which population is the abo-riginal natives Ð that that part situate ad-joining to the pacific, or in the high lands is a</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="142">
        <p>fine healthy country, equal in mildness and salubrity of climate to any in the world. 
The second in command in the course of con-versation, let me know, that he was the unfortunate re-mains of his family, all of whom, except one son who had accompanied him on board the AdmiralÕs ship before the action commenced, were blown up with the ship that took fire. How much does such a lamentable catastrophe call forth every sympathetic feeling of the heart, when the weak and inoffensive fall victims to a war in which they can take no part. When a warrior falls over heaps of his slaughtered foes, altho we may lament him as a friend, yet do we admire the glorious lustre of his exit, that he was breathed his last in a noble cause, rather than on the bed of loath-some disease. 
This morning I have been taking farewell of my friends; I set off for Bath in the afternoon after my return I shall endeavor to let you have some idea of that place famous in the annals of amusement Adieu</p>

        <p>London Jan 6, 1804
My Dr friend,
The evening after I concluded the last I wrote you, I took my departure from this city, in com-pany with my young friend, Ichawenndenhawighto, and travelled all night, for here the roads are so good, that carriages can without difficulty go as well by night as day Ð and early in the morning passed Blenheim house, the seat of the once celebrated Duke of Marlboro, ever famous in the military annals of Europe, for skill and courage Ð the house has the same name with a village in Germany, where he gave the French a woeful defeat. The country from here to Bath in the summer season must have a most delightful appearance, with the exception of some downs, it every where shows marks of the highest cul-tivation Ð we stopped to change horses at a town in Wiltshire, where a fair was held Ð there were exposed for sale droves of horses, cattle, and herds of bleating sheep Ð here the people speak quite a different dialect from that of London, and while we were passing I almost heard enough said to have learnt it could I have remembered all. Throughout England there is a variety of dialects among the peasantry; but gentlemen of some edu-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="144">
        <p>cation speak uniform, yet frequently these retain sufficient variation in their accent to denote the part of the island, in which they had spent their youthful days.
We arrived at Bath in the afternoon, in sufficient time for me to be introduced to dinner with the Members of the Bath &amp; West of England Agriculture Society, who honored me with the kindest attention it was so immediately after my arrival, that I had barely time to salute my friends the family of Shotsiciowane Ð and indeed at this place objects presented themselves to view in such quick succession, as hardly to leave time for observa-tion Ð one evening, I passed in a philosophical meeting, at Sir W Watsons another at the assembly rooms, where the fair skiped  gracefully in the varied dance, to the most enlivening strains of music.
At other times I was sauntering with my friends in the Pump room, where people came to drink water, or to see and be seen Ð and however some people in our neighborhood may disrelish the idea of meeting to drink water, I like the appearance of this assembly much better than those where they come together to drink strong water; and I</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="145">
        <p>assure that, I think our remaining drunkards should fall upon some plan similar to this, at least if it be true, what they have always told me, that is, that they drink from their fondness for company, not for the sake of the liquor; because if that is really the case, water might supply the place of liquor and they might enjoy each others company with greater sobriety, and part better friends than they sometimes do with the intoxicating beverage, they now make use of. 
In the afternoon at one side a celebrated gram-marian searched for the roots of our language, as another I was asked to the veracity of some descriptions given by historians of the natives of America; which was difficult for me to answer positively; because they might be true in particular instances and erroneous in general, or in the parts, which had came under my observation Ð At last, however, I was rescued by the benevolence of the ladies to give some account of your manners and customs Ð they particularly asked me, if it was true, that the women received such hard treat-ment as historians report Ð if they were really</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="146">
        <p>kept in a state of bondage I answered in the nega-tive, but that the laborious work they performed, was considered, as the branch of industry assigned them and they attended to it in the same manner, as a farmers wife might to her spinning wheel, without acknowledging a command or apprehending a reprimand Ð Many other queries were made, but in that pleasing manner, that I always derived pleasure in answering them; they however came in such quick succession from different quarters that I sometimes apprehended the answer intended for one might be taken by another.
Bath is a handsome town, here it is cal-led small; but in our parts would be considered great, it contains twenty thousand inhabitants, and itÕs principal support is the great concourse of people, that assemble there on account of the healing qualities of its waters, and others that are attracted there to enjoy the pleasures of so-ciety Ð for those, who come there are quite disen-gaged from all business, and therefore devote their time entirely to enjoyment Ð there are many excellent buildings in it, and the sur-rounding country beautiful and picturesque.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="147">
        <p>At a meeting of the Agricultural Society, they conferred on me the honor of making me an honorary member, for which mark of favor I returned my thanks, and acknowledgement in the best manner, I was capable of expressing, the sense of which was much heightened by the reflection of the very noble, and useful purposes for which the society was instituted.
Among the friends, I acquired at this place, one particularly drew my attention, and warmed my heart with reciprocal friendship, his Mr P_y O_n; his benevolent intentions towards your most serious interests merits the gratitude of you all Ð I obtained from the Rev Mr T_d some onthries of the nature of the Spanish language, and took a determination to learn it Ð to facilitate which my friend made me a present of a Spanish dictionary and I make a commence-ment. 
My friend introduced me to Gen. J_n who had been in America Ð he was a resident at that place; and by that means we had the good fortune to have sometimes the pleasure of his company, and that of his family.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="148">
        <p>While I was at this place I had also the honor being introduced by LÕH_y P_y of breakfasting with the nobleman, who made the Peace with America, and although the generality of the Aboriginal tribes were losers in territory by this treaty, it was not the least of his intention perhaps, in concluding it. He said, that he con-sidered Peace, one of the greatest of blessings, and for that reason, that all apprehension and jea-lousy might subside on the part of the weak-est nation, he thought it best to cause the forts to be delivered up to the Americans. 
It is time the Americans have urged this treaty, as the foundation of their claim to the territory of the tribes within that line, although in my opinion unjustly Ð yet had the tribes been unanimous in showing the same spirit, that a small number did in defence of their territory, they might have rendered this unjust claim of no effect. I also saw our friend Roghsennageghto</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="149">
        <p>who yet expresses the same sentiments of regard he always entertained for you: but it would be endless for me to recapitulate a personal ac-count of every one I saw there let it suffice to say, that with all to whom I had the honor of being known, I had the most pleasing intercourse, consistent with the urbanity and benevolence of their characters. 
As at that town no business is attended to except that of amusement, society much more diversified come together than at London. There the statesman, country gentleman the merchant the banker all meet; but at London the variety of their occupation generally se-parate them, at least they seem to move in different circles of associates. 
You have heard of so much having been asked about, that your curiosity, perhaps, is also excited to know something of those who enquire. The Ladies in England far exceed any thing you have an idea of from what you may have seen of the female sex Ð their beautiful ap-pearance is only to be exceeded by the excellence</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="150">
        <p>of their minds, and the manner in which these are decorated with useful knowledge, and in many elevated with the warmest affections of piety. English gentlemen although reserved it is certainly a mistake to say they are phleg-matic, they feel often more than they express: I am fully convinced no people can be more sensible of sincere friendship than they are. in general they are religious at least those that I had the pleasure of being acquainted with and I never met with any that treated, that subject with levity, as it is too frequently done in our neighborhood: those of consummate knowledge are not forward in showing it Ð so that a stran-ger may be some length of time before he knows their worth Ð but I have not seen enough to write correctly on this subject.
The day before I left Bath my friend Shotsiciowane took me to see Bristol, which is a seaport of considerable trade, and but a few miles from that place Ð it is a city of some extent, and I should suppose very populous, from the manner in which it is</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="151">
        <p>built, the natural stream of the river into which the ships enter is very small; but the tide raises it to such a height that vessels of almost any burthen may enter; we had here a grand view of the Welsh mountains on the opposite side of the Bristol Channel, which is an arm of the sea, that separates this part of England from Wales, and into which the river discharges itself. The trade there is principally carried on to America and the West Indies. I can-not tell you all the exports Ð but I believe that fine woollen cloaths from one of the many articles there bring several manufactories of super fine broad cloaths in the West of England; after taking some refreshment at a kind friends Mr H_d we returned to bath. I had almost omitted giving you any account of the labors of the Agricultural society Ð They endeavor by all means to find the methods to be taken to raise the greatest quantity of produce from the land without injuring it Ð and the species of cattle, which may be raised and fatted to the greatest advantage Ð ex-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="152">
        <p>periments are made of intermixing the various breeds of cattle, and such intermixtures, as are found to be profitable are published; I saw some wool of a sheep which was said to be from a mixture of the Spanish with the English breed, and it was finer than the original Spanish, which is considered to be the finest of any in the world.
As the object of this society is fully attained, it will tend in no inconsiderate degree to render the population and power of Britain greater Ð com-merce populates the town, an improvement in agri-culture and putting under cultivation a greater number of acres will increase the population of the country and that will augment the internal trade of the towns. It is a source of power and riches less subject to change than commerce, because it is independent of foreign connection.
I leave Bath for this city in the Mail very little before sundown, so that the sight was not much indulged, for at sunrise we were at Hyde Park near the entry of Picadilly the distance we came in that time about one hundred miles Ð the roads being very good we travelled on a steady trot, changing horses in twelve or eighteen miles, and in the intermediate distance stopping a minute or two for them and the driver to drink.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="153">
        <p>As soon as I got out of the coach, I walked two or three miles to see my friend Shakorharats-teni, and hear what news, I arrived in time to breakfast with him; - and had a pleasing interview, I went home, and after dinner walked out to see my friends at C_m; and have the pleasure to hear that Shakodenhre is ar-rived at his house in town from the country. I took the first opportunity to call upon him, when I had the pleasure of seeing him and his amiable family. 
I then went to look out a teacher of Spa-nish, I had been directed to from Bath, and com-menced to take some lessons; but a little time after I heard he was not equal to M. Jos; and what confirmed me in the correctness of this informa-tion, was that he also taught French in which I could perceive he was very imperfect, I therefore looked out Mr Jos, &amp; found him a very genteel French Abb Ð and after having talked a considerable time on the subject Ð I took my lesson with an intention to return continually until I should have acquired a perfect know-ledge of it.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="154">
        <p>While at Bath, I had received a letter from my excellent friend S	requesting me to accompany him on a visit to Cambridge, I had now another on the same subject; but many occurring cir-cumstances put it then out of my power to go to that celebrated seminary of learning Ð I am therefore obliged to defer giving myself that gratification.
A long time since, I had been introduced to Shakoyadarase, a celebrated painter, a man of real taste, this gentleman had requested me to sit for a likeness, which I did Ð and I had thus an opportunity of seeing the manner in which he forms the lively, and striking likeness that he does Ð A day that he had invited me to dine with him, in the evening he took me to the Academy there I saw the young artists making their essays, they were as intense on the object of their studies, as a hunter just getting within shot of their game, he is in pursuit of Ð their attention seemed to be absorbed from every other object to this alone. Parliament is just going to sitt, and my friend Shakorharatstenne has promised to get me introduced there, in my next I shall give you some account of it Adieu</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="155">
        <p>London, Feb. 2, 1804
My Dr Friend,
As in my last I mentioned, that my friend I had promised to get me introduced, he gave me for that purpose a line to a Noble Lord Ð who with the greatest politeness took me in with him, and placed me among the Ambassadors. The house was filled with the noble peers, and not long after the park guns fired in salutation to His Majesty, in a few minutes after our good King enters in his Royal robes attended by some Lords. He sat down on his throne and after taking a view of the house began his speech, the purport of which was to set forth the hostile intentions of the enemy apparent from all his movements, at the same time ex-pressing the high sense His Majesty felt at the loyalty of his loving subjects in voluntarily offering their service in the defence of the King-dom; and which appeared sufficient for its internal defence, also informing them that from the un-fortunate situation of Spain, subject to the controul of the enemy in such a degree as to give strong suspicions her neutrality was not perfect, that therefore after in effectual</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="156">
        <p>negotiation, it had been found necessary to take such strong measures, as to constrain her to give sufficient security for her sincere neutrality or to appear as an open enemy. 
And that notwithstanding the hostile pro-ceedings of the enemy, yet His Majesty had received from his overtures of a pacific nature; but that by reason of his engagements with his brother the Emperor of Russia, he could not in any ways accede to them, until he had consulted him. In the meantime His Majesty pidged it neces-sary for the security of his kingdoms, and dig-nity of his crown to prosecute the war with vigor, and to effect which he relied on his loving subjects for the necessary support.
His Majesty looked well in health, and although the unfortunate state of Europe obliged him to mediate on war, yet his countenance gave strong expression of the humanity, and benevolence of his heart. A few minutes after he had concluded his speech, he retired with his attendants. Ð a cry was made to clear the house; but I suppose it could only have meant of the ladies, for as I was going to retire the noble Lord who introduced me, met me, and told me,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="157">
        <p>that I might stay as long as I pleased Ð this custom which is ancient, that the ladies should not be present, during a debate in the House of Parlia-ment, at first sight does not savour of gallantry, yet on further consideration I think it does, for it is a candid acknowledgement of their power and sway over the minds of the legis-lators of their country. 
The debates in the House of Lords began respecting the wording of the address to be presented to His Majesty, as touching that part of his speech relative to hostilities with Spain Ð and I had the good fortune to meet Ichaka-enyo, who informed me of the titles of the noble Lords. After I had heard Lord G_le make a very fine speech and another Lord I went out, and returned to the city as expeditiously as I could having been engaged that day to dine with young Mr. H_re M_ after a little conversa-tion on what had passed, where I had been, the papers were brought in which contained His MajestyÕs speech, so expeditious are the printers in taking these things off.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="158">
        <p>The next afternoon Ichaka-enyo gave me an introduction to the gallery of the House of Commons. There the same business, I had before heard debated in the House of Lords commenced Ð the Master of the Rolls in a manly speech explained the reasons for, and justified the seizure of the Spanish ships in a clear perspicuous man-ner; Mr Fox with powerful eloquence, thoÕ irre-gular, and a fund of wit and humor, attached the proceedings of the Ministry, representing the seizure of the Spanish ships previous to declaration of war as highly dishonorable to the nation, some other speakers of the opposition arose, one of whom treated the subject, as if he had forgot it was a national question, wherein there is no courts to bring suit Ð there was also some others spoke on the side of the Minister; but at last the all powerful elo-quence of Mr Pitt bore down, like the mountain torrent, when swelled by the melted snows, all opposition Ð the house was cleared as is the custom, of all the people in the gallery, and the votes taken, which gave a majority on the side of the Ministry Ð I went home with my friend Ichaka-enyo.</p>

        <p>London February 15, 1808
My Dear Friend, 
After I wrote to you my last I deter-mined to visit that celebrated nursery of learning the University of Cambridge. It is situate about fifty miles to the Northward of London. From which I took my departure at about eight o clock in the morning in the stage coach, and arrived at Cambridge at about three o clock in the afternoon; I repaired immediately to the house occupied by my worthy friend Iharihowanen who together with his very kind family gave me a hearty wel-come; he said, we had almost given up hopes of seeing you here; but where I am to dine today, I promised to take you with me, should you arrive soon enough, and I am glad your coming at the time you have enables you to be of our party. 
As soon as I had dressed we went to join these worthy gentlemen and though we were rather late, their politeness pre-vented it being apparent.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="160">
        <p>The important station filled by these worthy gentlemen to whose care is assigned the formation, and improvement of the minds of the illustrious youth of this great nation, that are intended one day to shine in the Senate or the field, together with that strong expression of mental talents and extensive knowledge, so conspicuous in their countenances, struck my mind with awe on first entering; but their affability, pleasing manners, and good humour soon relieved me, and you must not be surprised, when I tell you, that in society of these eminent characters; I learned a lesson for moderation, which I hope the warmth of my temper may never cause me to forget; that is to support in conversation an opinion contrary to others, with a modest firmness, giving the rea-sons for it with such mildness, as to convince without seeming to contradict. Indolence, I believe, is frequently the cause</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="161">
        <p>of the politeness observed by many of our friends, of not contradicting assertions they doubt or of which they are not convinced; but here it is the effect of a dominion justly assumed by reason over passion, which teaches us to convince our opponent without hurting his vanity or indulging our own.
After passing with these worthy gen-tlemen a pleasant afternoon, and having the mind as well as the body delicious-ly regaled, we retired home, where after some pleasant conversation, we joined in supplication to the Heavenly Throne, and then went to repose and prepare for indulging curiosity to its utmost extent the next day, in viewing the many things worthy to be seen in this ancient and celebrated seminary of knowledge. 
The next morning after breakfast my worthy friend S_ took me out, to call upon some of our friends, and</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="162">
        <p>to take a view of the University; we began with the library, which contains many volumes, there is also here the manuscript of one of the finest poems in the English language written by the celebrated Milton; - who was educated at this University Ð here I saw several collections of these rarities deemed curiosities, some Egyptian Mummies, which are bodies preserved from putrefaction by a peculiar process, one of these was said to have been preserved for upwards of two thousand years, and had become like cinders Ð Surprising, that so much pains had been taken to preserve the less valuable part of man, an inanimate lump of clay, which might as well have been left to moulder with its kindred earth Ð statues, formed of a substance made of rice, nearly resem-ble marble, said to have been brought from China Ð work ornamented with porcupine quils from our country Ð several busts of Ancient Philosophers</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="163">
        <p>On leaving the library we walked through the avenues of the University down the park to the banks of the Cam, which is a fine little river, and I formed in my imagination perhaps only a faint idea of the beauty of the landscape when nature paints every thing in its most pleasing colours. 
After taking this walk we prepared for diner, and on our way called on L_ H_ I had the pleasure to learn, that my good young friend Dyonheghkon was at this place, and in walking over the Court to the Hall, where we dined had the satisfaction to meet him; we walked there together; I found it very capacious, nothing to interrupt the view to the top, where there is a hole to let out the smoke of a small fire, burning in the centre; and which has coloured the inside of the roof in some degree similar to those of our houses Ð there is many tables in this</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="164">
        <p>Hall, that bear some resemblance to the sim-plicity of ancient times in this country; before their mechanics had attained to that elegance in their work, which they so generally possess at the present day. However when the dishes, that were to cover them were brought Ð they appeared to be sufficient conformity to modern taste. 
After dining we retired to a smaller, and warmer room, where we spent several hours very agreeably; until it was time to repair to the room of L_ H. where we were to sup with a number of friends Iyonheghhion also being of the party Ð The conversation was lively and brilliant, and the time slipt away so imperceptibly, that it was mid-night, before I could have wished it or imagined I had been there any time Ð
We retired and the next morning went to see the Chapel of KingÕs college a majestic an-cient building I believe in the Gothic stile.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="165">
        <p>which it is the first attempt of the ancestors of the prevent inhabitants of Europe, at architecture, some centuries after they had demolished the elegant fabrics of the Greeks and Romans, and themselves be-gan to desire to have something more in their buildings, than what was absolutely necessary Ð the Gothic, appears to me to have more of grandeur than beauty in its composition: and there seems to be nothing deficient that might contribute to its streng-th, what I found curious in this, is that the top is a solid arch of stone, without any supporting pillars.
This day we dined with Mr B_ with a party considerably numerous, the afternoon we passed very agreeably as usual and in the evening went to prayers in the Chapel of KingÕs college Ð and some time after, we went to sup with Djonheghkon Ð here we again met a considerable party at St Johns College, the conversation turned principally on American sub-jects.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="166">
        <p>During my short stay here I was highly gratified with the kind attention of all the worthy characters, I had the honor of being known to, and the good qualities I saw so conspicuous in my noble young friend increased the ardor of my friendship for him Ð although at a late hour, it was with regret I parted with him Ð intending early next morning to set off for London. 
At nine o clock we leave Cam-bridge in post chaise. we passed through a country which although well cultivated yet is generally destitute of fences. as our carriage rolled on rapidly, I enjoyed the pleasing and instructive conversation of my friend. We arrive at Ware a town situate on the River Lea about 20 miles from London, for which we proceeded.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="167">
        <p>(empty page)</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="168">
        <p>We arrive at London early in the afternoon without any thing in particular occurring Ð I return to my friend Rakke-denro, who I find very well only much occupied Ð we spent the evening very pleasantly together.
The next day I meet a committee of the British &amp; Foreign Bible Society, who have generously been at the expense of print-ing my translation of the Gospel of St John for your use, which is now nearly finished, the gratitude, I felt towards them for this benevolent act Ð I now ex-pressed to them in a few words as well as I was capable. 
I went out to Clapham to visit my worthy friends there Ð and in town I was often with my dear friend Ichakaenyon Ð I had an invitation from a worthy gentleman in the neighborhood of Culham, I went there to dine with my friend S_ E_ N</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="169">
        <p>We were received by this worthy gentleman (who is a friend of Ihayendanegen,) and his Lady with the most pleasing affability Ð we met there an aged Admiral and a young gentleman, who had been at Botany Bay in a public situation Ð this is a Great Island in the Southern Ocean, its extent is of such magnitude, as almost entitles it to the denomination of Continent Ð In this country a settlement has been forming, this twenty years past Ð composed of people convicted of various crimes Ð who it is supposed, when re-moved from temptation, may refrain from their vicious practices; it is sufficiently evident, that where they are, all rogues to-gether, they must of necessity learn the value of honesty; because they find none else to prey upon but each other. How-ever it cannot fail of being a very difficult task for people of character, who are sent there to govern, to keep these ruffians in order, and as the colony is continually on the increase unless they become moral in proportion to</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="170">
        <p>the time they have been there, the difficulty we may suppose will increase. The climate is salubrious, and it is much to the honor of British humanity to give this asylum to the wretched offenders of the laws, where they can support themselves by labor, and where they can hardly have any hopes or temptation to attempt to live by dishonest practices. 
The Aboriginal Natives of this coun-try are few, and perhaps in the rudest state man is found, in any quarter of the world Ð this may be partly owing to the few objects they have to call forth their ingenuity: the temperature of the climate enables them to go without clothing the sea furnishes them with fish in abun-dance, in the catching of which they show sufficient art; but there exists among them no agriculture, and I hear there is only one species of animals to give them employment at the chace Ð this is about the size of a faun in the fall of the year; but</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="171">
        <p>singular in its shape, the hind legs are long-er much than the fore, and the tail at the root the thickness of a mans by ta-pering to the end is so strong, that they stand upon it. 
The admiral, who had also been in this country conversed respecting it, and also about South America, where he had been when young Ð he said the natives are in some parts numerous and warlike; but the Spaniards take care to prevent them ob-taining fire arms. 
After passing the evening very agree-ably, I went home with my friend S_ where I yet had the pleasure of some conversa-tion before we retired to take our repose Ð he observed, that the gentleman with whom we had dined, had many years been a faithful servant to his King, and country, and that his abilities being of the most respectable, cause him to have some part to act in most ad-ministrations; thus you see it is not always as some represent among Europeans, that is, that birth and fortune grasp all power, and</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="172">
        <p>leave nothing to merit except the drudgery of an inferior station Ð this is not always the case, merit, when rendered conspicuous by exertion, has also its price. 
The next morning I took farewel of my dear friend, and his family for a few days, their affectionate regard raised in my breast every sentiment of gratitude, and friendship. I could not but consider them as kindred; and I returned to town, I found with my friend there a very worthy gentleman who I shall call Shakoriwaw?se, and we had together much conversation, he seems to be a man of a very strong mind, and a warm be-nevolent temper, which may perhaps some-times lead him to be offended with those, who through supineness allow of oppressions as well as with the oppressors. Had he lived in those times previous to the existence of law or when its power was yet weak, he certainly would have ranked among the most celebrated knights, that rescued the weak and humble from the oppressive arm of the strong and powerful Ð As times</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="173">
        <p>now are he has exerted and yet exerts all the powers of eloquence to call the attention, and humanity of this great nation to regard the sufferings of the poor Africans with a compassive eye, and loosen their chains or at least prevent the shameful traffic in the human spe-cies, which depopulates the shores of Africa and I sincerely hope that He who has formed and supports all men of every language, and complexion may finally bless with success the virtuous endeavors of British Philanthropists. 
The next day, I went again to Clap-ham to see my worthy friends Shotsiciowa-ne and his family Ð After dinner we went together with Ichaghnawateghwa, to Rot-yesen, we talked on various subjects, and the conversation turning on books, the Encyclopedia was spoken of as being a library in itself, when this generous gentleman made me an offer of it, in the most friendly manner, and I accepted it with every sentiment of gratitude, for a present, which contains the history, and scientific acquisitions of ages.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="174">
        <p>We returned home, and the next day, we went to the Royal institution, where Orators give lectures on moral philosophy, Mechanics &amp;. The Orator, who spoke is very justly celebrated for eloquence, his language is smooth and flowing, and his ideas are expressed with vivacity and pre-cision, he is instructive and amusing and for my part, I listen with pleasure, and when he concludes, wish he had spoken longer; but his redundancy of humor rather lessens the dignity of his elocution; and those who require a modest appearance in an Orator, he may perhaps displease.
On seeing the nature of this institution, I was directly struck with the idea, of the usefulness of something similar being established among us Ð for it is found useful here, where all can read, if they are not too indolent to search knowledge in books; it can not fail of being of great-er utility with us, where few can read, at least the languages in which books are printed.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="175">
        <p>After we came out, I again returned to Clapham, where I met a number of my friends, and passed the evening with that satisfaction, which the society of the virtuous, the wise, the beautiful and the agreeable never fails to give.
In the morning I return to town, call upon my friend Ichakaenyo, and pass some part of the day with him, he reads a passage from a celebrated author Ferguson respecting our tribes, of which he wished to know the correctness, it was a more true picture than most writings I have seen Ð excepting that part describing the method of carrying on war; which confounded the cautious manner pursued by small parties, with the method of greater bodies intent on striking a blow of consequence. 
My friend gave me his medal, &amp; I again went to the institution Ð and on my return went to dine with him, I there met two Military gentlemen of distinction, and a friend I had long</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="176">
        <p>been acquainted with, there was only one lady with Yoriwiyosto. After a little talk on indifferent subjects the conversation turn-ed on war; and I was led to relate the successes of our tribes to the westward, and their method of attack Ð One of these gentlemen related an affair in Holland at which he was present Ð in which fif-teen hundred men of the guards, advance-ing through a narrow defile, on the enemies works, last a hundred men in a quarter of an hour; yet notwithstanding took the en-trenchments, although defended by seven thousand men; this shows the advantage possessed by those who attack, when they advance rapidly with determined courage. every advantage but this, the enemy seemed to have possessed, yet they were defeated by such great inferiority of numbers.
After separating, I go in company with one of the gentlemen and Miss Ich [DR15]Ð as far as St James Street, where I get out, to call on a gentleman ami-able for his many virtues &amp; good qualities.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="177">
        <p>After remaining a little while there, I returned with my kind friend W_ H re.
All people are now in agitation res-pecting a motion that has been made by Mr Whitbread for the impeachment of Lord Melville, it was carried by one vote only which was given by the speaker, otherwise the House of Commons divided equal.
The subject of this impeachment, I do not correctly understand; but it seems to be, the having allowed his deputy to risk the pub-lic money in stock jobbing, several years ago, when he was treasurer to the Navy, and secretary of State at the same time. it does not appear that the public has lost any thing; but then it has been done contra-ry to an express law; which it is said Lord Melville himself proposed. 
There are many who speak respectfully of him, and think high of his abilities, regret the loss it will be to the Nation the withdrawing of his talents from its Coun-cils; yet the reverence they have for their laws, and their integrity in supporting them obliged them to vote against him.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="178">
        <p>There is great preparation for war, but the destination is uncertain; a blow is however meditated on some part of the enemyÕs terri-tories; should an expected expedition take place I have the promise of accompanying it, and it is this expectation keeps me from visiting the country at any distance from London. However I do not know any part where I could be more happy than I am here with my friends, nor any place where I could have so many in so small a compass. In short every thing almost that is to be seen in the Kingdom, may be seen here, so that there is hardly any thing deficient wherewith to indulge my curiosity, unless it may be variety of landscape. 
Here are assembled the first people of the Kingdom, as statesmen, legislators philosophers, and the eminent in all professions, Here is also the manufacture and produce not only of every part of the Kingdom but of every part of the world. If there is some evil, it cannot be denied that there is also much good; which experience authorises me to affirm.</p>

Dr Friend
After I last wrote to you I went again to Clapham where I passed the Sunday with my friends, and in attending divine worship, where I heard an edifying sermon: it was generally either here or at Fulham I remained on that day, set apart for religious instruction and meditations, and for a day of rest from worldly employments.
I returned to town, and calling on the brother of Mr Sh_ I find him preparing that afternoon to attend a parade in St PaulÕs Church yard; he belonged to a regiment of the city volunteers, I took a walk along to see them Ð they made a good appearance with their uniform, and their polished arms; but the place where they formed was too small to admit of their perform-ing any military evolutions; this corps is chiefly composed of citizens, and althoÕ many of them might be too delicate to undergo a Campaign, yet their spirit,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="180">
        <p>and patriotism might enable them to perform wonders in the day of battle.
I went to see my venerable friend Rowayadoro, the gentleman to whom I was first introduced, it gave me pleasure to see them; but I could hardly admit their assertion of its having been five months since I had been there, until on reflection, I found the account just Ð When we feel happy and easy in our mind, and particularly, when it is diverted by diversified occupations or amusements, time slips away so impercep-tibly, that an age seems but a few days. We cannot in such a situation be too careful of its passing unprofitably. The good old lady of the house has unfortunately through sickness lost her eye sight; religion teaches to submit with patience to the decision of God; and when nature leads us to sympa-thise with the afflicted, it should also lead us to make grateful acknowledgements to the Supreme, for the many mercies he daily shows, in preserving from many of the misfortunes incident to this life.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="181">
        <p>That afternoon we walked over the fields to the house of a worthy friend, there we found with him another of his acquaintance, and after conversing a little on the critical situation of the times, in which these good gentlemen show-ed their perfect reliance, on the protecting arm of the all wise disposer of events, we took a turn or two in the garden, which is very neatly laid out Ð althoÕ it is rather cold here at this time, yet not having such severe frosts, as we usually experience in our climate, several things of early vegetation are beginning to sprout; besides the abundance of evergreens, with which the gardens here are decorated; give them a beautiful appearance. 
We return to Walthamstow, and the next day I went to town, where I remain all day with my friend Rakkidenro, and complete the correction of the last impression of the translation Ð
The next day I call Col. GÐle he proposes to take me to the play, when the King attends it, that I might have the plea-sure of seeing the King, the Queen and</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="182">
        <p>Royal family together, and assured me that as soon as an opportunity offered he would let me know. In the afternoon I went to hear the debates in the House of Commons with my young friend IÕhawadenhawightha, Mr W-m spoke for three hours, he proposed, the new modelling of the army, in a very able manner, and with so much humor, and viva-city, that I believe most of the hearers, did not feel the time tedious, during which he expatiated on Military subjects of which he showed a perfect knowledge. 
He denied the system by which men received two bounties on entering the service; the one on enlisting in the militia, and the other on enlisting out of that into the regular army, alledging that in consequence of such an arrangement few men would enter im-mediately into the regular troops, they would naturally prefer two bounties to one, and to obtain them would of course first enter into the militia Ð he set forth the continued rise of the bounty money; which he attri-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="183">
        <p>buted to the custom of obliging people to find substitutes, he observed, that he knew some elderly ladies of his acquaintance, who for fear of being metamorphosed into dragoons, had actu-ally given sixty guineas bounty for a substi-tute. he proposed to remedy this abuse that the army in itself should be rendered a desirable si-tuation to people of that rank, which fill it Ð by giving the soldiers such privileges and res-pectful treatment, as they could not have hoped to have attained in the rank of society, they were placed, previous to their enlisting; he mentioned for an instance worthy of imitation, the custom the French government have of appropriating seats in the Theatre for the indulgence of the soldiery Ð But in urging the increase of the regular army, he treated too disrespectfully the volunteers in compar-ing them to an army painting, with respect to foreign services it may be just, because they are not to go out of the Kingdom; but should the country be attacked, I think the spirit of loyalty and patriotism, which</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="184">
        <p>has called them to arms, with the innate courage of Britons, that animates their breasts, will enable them to convince him of his mistake and the injustice he does them. Mr Fox I believe was to have supported the motion; but he stayed too long, and before he could get in to speak, a question was called and it was cast out by considerable ma-jority. 
We then retired and got to Mr S_ before they had all gone to bed, and lodged there that night, from these worthy people I always received the most hospital-ble treatment Ð In the morning after break-fast I went home, and as I usually did, when I had leisure, amused myself in learning Spanish, until it was time to pre-pare for dinner; Shotsiciowane and me we were to dine that day with Shakorha-ratstenmi Ð we met there Col. W_n and two American gentlemen, together with Sir J. H_ I was surprised pleasingly in meeting C. W. never having heard of his being in the country, until then when</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="185">
        <p>I learned he had left Canadas?ke Lake on Sep-tember Last Ð we passed a pleasant afternoon and on retiring I went home with my friend to Clapham. 
On Sunday, I went to Fulham to hear Sh__ preach, he gave us an excellent sermon calculated to awaken Christian zeal by pointing out the early part of the life of our blessed saviour, as an example as well as the object of reverential love: the text was Ð and he increased in stature and in wisdom, and in favor with God and man.
We returned to Clapham, and I went to dine with Roriwakero Ð and there I also passed the afternoon Ð in the evening we went to church, and heard an excellent sermon, the text if you keep my word, then you will be my disciples indeed. 
I went to London next day and from there to Fulham, to go with my friend I_ to Putney where we were invited, we pass the afternoon very agreeably; we met there with some other gentlemen Col. R_ who invited us the next Monday</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="186">
        <p>to an evening party. 
On returning to town; I accompanied my friend Ranigonraghsnore to see the animals assembled at the Barbican, there was a vast variety, the intention is to show what breed or mixture may be raised with the greatest profit and least expence to the owner. 
I spent the afternoon at Mr. S_ns; where I met Ihawenndonhawightha &amp; Ta-yorhensere; in the evening I go to hear my friend WA lecture on Electricity at GuyÕs Hos-pital Ð but I cannot describe to you what I there heard on the subject Ð I think the best way to attend lectures with advan-tage, is to acquire some previous know-ledge of the subject Ð For here while I was considering the beginning of the lecture Ð the intense reverie it caused, partly shut my ears to the succeeding part, so that when all was ended, I possessed but a very confused idea of the whole. When he had concluded, we went together</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="187">
        <p>to the Botanic Society. 
The next day, I went to Clapham, where after writing a few hours at Shotsitciowa-ne-gue, I prepared to go to dine with Ro-righwaw?go, I there met a worthy gentleman the head of the Missionary Society, that has converted, and continues to improve our nephew, of the Delaware Nation, who listen to their voice, and attend to the precepts of Christian-ity. The conversation turned principally on the misfortunes of these poor people, when the Wyndotts obliged them to leave their village on the Muskingum, and brought them to Sandusky, where they were distressed for want of provisions, and those who return-ed to gather the corn, they had left at their village were murdered in cold blood by the Americans. 
After taking leave of these worthy gentlemen, I unison went to Sir B_t, B_yÕs on the christening of his child Ð I met there an elegant and very numerous assembly Ð Music, wit, and beauty charmed the scene.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="188">
        <p>The dance was pursued with mirth and vivacity and when the company had a little fatigued themselves, an elegant supper was served Ð after it was cleared away, the cheerful dance was renewed, which we continued until near two o clock, we then retired highly gratified with the urbanity and hospitality of our host. On going out a blunder caused me to appease more officiously polite, than otherwise, I would have had the assurance to have been Ð as I had went in my own dress, on account of the coldness of the weather I had thrown a plaid of tartan over my shoulders, on entering I had left it at the door with the cloaks of the company: When I came to the door I saw one, which I laid hold of supposing to be it; but on seeing a lady near me, politely thank me for my civility I threw it over her shoulders, imagining I had made a mistake, which I found to be the case, when on taking another look, I perceived mine laying under the heap.</p>

      <div type="page" n="189">
        <p>The next day after going to town, I prepared to dine with IÕharighway?ritsin. 
I was received by him, his lady, and sister in law with the greatest kindness and civility, I had been introduced to these wor-thy people by my friend S_ to whom they are near neighbors in the sum-mer season Ð I met there several gentle-men, one of whom is son to the Archbishop of York; the conversation turned principally on American subjects, the pleasure I felt in the society of these good people caused me to remain until rather a late hour, when I took leave promising to call again.
The next day after writing a few hours, I went to hear my friend WA lecture at the Royal Institution on the mecha-nical structure of clocks, and on the na-ture of steam Engines, which he described with great accuracy.

        <p>ed into the British service, and that in dying had left his mother, who now lay sick, in great distress with a helpless family Ð I asked if he could speak English; but he answered in the nega-tive Ð this caused me to suspect him, for I thought that his own story showed he had been long enough with the English for a boy of his age to have learned the language Ð I however thought it best if I made any mistake to make it on the right side, so I gave him what I could, and wished I had been able to have taken them under my protection, should their situation be really so deplorable as he described. 
I dined with my very kind friend Ranigonrio in Fleet street Ð After talking on various subjects, the conversation turned upon language, the brother of my friend who is also my friend, and who I shall ever have a great esteem for; expressed a doubt, of our language being capa-ble of expressing every idea that might</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="191">
        <p>occur to a sublime or refined conception, my affection for things absent rather than my reason caused me to dispute this assertion; alledging that there is no idea but what we can express, had I said ex-plain I might have been nearly right Ð For a strange idea which in English is expressed by a single word, requires in our language either a long compound or a sentence to make it understood. It is however true that the English lan-guage has become copious by the adoption of words from other languages. It was rather late when I parted from these worthy friends, I however had yet a little conversation with my good friend before we took our repose, on the subject of his lecture. 
The next day, I dined with Icha-ka-enyo, there were several gentlemen there among these was a great Canadian merchant and his son Ð while we were at dinner and conversing on va-rious subjects, Mr Ichakaenyo</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="192">
        <p>asked me to give my opinion, what change, says he, do you think we should make in general, so as to thereby become better, at first I declined answering; because I apprehended, I had not yet seen suffici-ently the various springs, on which the com-pleiate machinery of a great civilized na-tion move, to decide correctly on such a position Ð but he observed, stran-gers see frequently at first sight, what had long passed unnoticed by the inhabitants of the country, and I hope therefore you will give us your idea Ð I then said, that, to suppress all unnecessary wants as much as possible might be of service Ð and a young merchant present, yet carried the point farther by proposing to supress the necessary.
I breakfasted at RangonrioÕs &amp; on my way to Clapham called on Shakorharatstenni, as I turned the corner, I observed, the boy I had seen before in the strand, and who could then only speak French, playing at marbles, and scolding at his playmates in very good English Ð thus you see, that the beggars here are people of tolerable talents, which if properly applied, might be of use to soci-ety. 
I proceeded to Clapham; and ar-rived rather late for church, however I went in, and heard an excellent sermon, after which, I partook in the LordÕs supper, what a happy tranquility possesses the soul, when in such a place, and with such asso-ciates. I dined at Rorighwak?roÕs with several friends, and also slept there.
The next day I return to town and call upon Mr Inglis, as we had arranged, when we saw each other at Ichaka-enyoÕs. The young gentleman took me to see the Quebec shipping, the London docks, vast product of industry and labor, which greatly favors commerce, in facilitating the loading and unloading of vessels. Then he took me to see the extensive store houses, containing the furs, that are brought from the different parts of</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="194">
        <p>America, what immense heaps much of it from the most remote parts of the North West, which is easy to be perceived from the kinds, and qualities of the furs and peltries; but when I saw the skins from the shores of Lake Erie, the Miami and Wabash it called to my mind my friends, as I knew it to be the produce of their hunting, purchasers for these articles assemble from different parts, and then they are put up at auction, when the highest bidder takes them; this is the reason, I believe, that when there is a general peace in Europe these things sell at higher price, because the purchasers are then more numerous. 
After this walk I dined with Mr S_ and in the evening went to Fulham to prepare for the ball at Col. K_ I accompanied my friend, and his amiable lady to Putney; we arrived and found the company nearly assembled Ð our host and hostess received us in the most pleasing manner and we passed the time in</p>

      <div type="page" n="195">
        <p>polite and enlivening conversation until the dance began Ð The music struck up &amp; and activity began to add charms to beau-ty Ð with grace and dignity, they performed the nimble movements excited by the lively airs. I was requested to make a short speech, and to dance the warriorÕs dance Ð the first I danced the flash, and then the Miskevathige dance, with all of which, I had the happiness to please my friends. Afterwards on a young lady undertaking to teach me the European dance, I got up, and began to move as well as I could, and I do not know how I performed; but this I know, that I felt very happy in dancing with such part-ners and to such enchanting mu-sic Ð As in this life we always think our portion of happiness to be of short duration, so did I find it now, for it appeared to be past midnight, before I thought we had been any time together and we retired.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="196">
        <p>After my return being occupied writing in the closet of my friend; I was surprised by the arrival of Col._ G_l, he said, I have called to let you know, that we have now a box opposite to that in which the Royal Family will sit; &amp; if you can get ready at so short notice, we will take you there this evening: I felt more grateful than I could well express for the attention he thus honored me with; and finding I had no time to lose, I immediately ran to acquaint my friend when son S intended Indron to accompany me; I had left my dress at Fulham, which put us to some stand, as we had hardly sufficient time to get it from there; however he dispatched a lad on horseback for it, and in the mean time I pre-pared another, lest I should be disappointed in his coming. 
I then set off for the west end of the town, where my friend Shakoyanenhawe lived, I found him at dinner, and learned, that the clothes had already been brought there; I then told him that I expected that he</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="197">
        <p>would go with me after dinner we got ready, and about the dusk of the evening we went in his coach, to the Theatre. Where we got out and enquired for the box of the C_ of M_ passing through the throng, we were showed into it. Our friends had not yet arrived; we sat down and in a few minutes they came in, the C of M. L. G. L. M. and his brother, also Lady A. the Col. Expressed great satisfaction at finding us there. 
A little time before the play began, His Majesty, the beloved Father of his people, arrived, salutations expressing the joy felt at his appearance, were reiterated from all quarters, to which he answered with an affable inclination of the head, Her Majesty the Queen and the Princesses also arrived; they seated themselves in a box, directly opposite to the one we were in, and I saw L. M. and M. P_ standing behind them.
The Kork?a was no sooner seated than he took out his glass, and began to take a view of our box; he gave it also to those, who sat next to him; - but the play opening called of our attentions, to view</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="198">
        <p>the celebrated actor Mr Kemble perform a character, that had by his fondness for study banished almost every social feeling from his breast, and yet he said he loved his books, because they taught him to love mankind Ð Love however at last reallumed the latent sparks of affection in his breast, and his ridiculous appearance, when he first felt the dart of Cupid, highly diverted us.  
My attention was continually drawn from the play to view our beloved sove-reign and his family. The catastrophe of the play, however, rather struck me as unnatural Ð a negro is there introduced a miracle of fidelity and affection, who when he perceives his Master intent on assassinating an enemy, he abhors the crime, and uses every argument to dissuade his Master from its perpetration; yet un-dertakes it himself to preserve guiltless his Master Ð had it been to spare him the danger of the enterprize, it would have appeared more like the effect of a strong natural affection; but whoever has</p>

      <div type="page" n="199">
        <p>that delicacy of morals, as to shudder at the person, he loves involving himself in guilt will hardly himself become criminal, and to prevent him committing a crime, perpetrate the deed himself. 
The play was followed by a farce, that was highly entertaining, the scene was in Switzerland; it was intermixed with songs, in commemoration of their having obtained their liberty, by the undaunted bravery of William Tell, and their ancestors, and others of a less grave composition; the subject is principally love Ð and the disappointed lover taking advantage of the turbulence of the times, obtains an arrest for his rival, and his father Ð however they are at last rescued by the ingenuity of an English servant, who is the most diverting character in the piece, it concludes, and we part with out noble friends, and return home. 
The next day, I go with my friend, Shotsitciowane to Clapham, there I pass the day, and in the afternoon, I accompany Ichawenndenherwighth?, and two of his sisters to dine with Mr H_ we are agreeably entertained by our host &amp; his family.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="200">
        <p>In the evening I went with Mr &amp; Miss H_, to the London Assembly, we were received with every mark of attention, by the managers the company was brilliant, nu-merous and agreeable; but so crowded, that I could hardly see those I knew; there was scarcely sufficient room for dancing; however notwithstanding, some performed a little; we retired before a late hour; rather fa-tigued with being in a throny than with dancing, at the same time much gratified with the agreeable manners and urbanity of the company. 
I am going to dine today with a worthy gentleman, who has a family highly accomplished, two of his sons are particularly my friends; they are yet young in years but possess the knowledge of the aged, they promise fair, if the Great Spirit preserve their lives to become one day an orna-ment to their country Ð Adieu</p>

        <p>London April 25, 1808 
Dear Friend, 
After passing the afternoon very pleasantly with the enlightened and agreeable company we found there, one of the young gentlemen condescended to dress in the East Indian habit, in the robes of Tip-poo Sultan, these are long and reach to the ancle, is tightened round the waist by a sash, there is a long piece of cloth, tied about the head, called a turban, the whole forms a dignified appearance; but the dress seems more feminine than manly; it is not at all calculated for ex-ertion. 
The next day in the forenoon I was employed as usual reading and writing; in the afternoon, I went to dine with the worthy clergyman at Clapham, I also spent the Sunday with him; the conver-sation turned principally on religion, he said, we should all turn our minds first to the one thing needful, that is to love</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="202">
        <p>the Lord our God with all our hearts, and have a lively faith in Jesus Christ; and regard every thing else as secondary objects, he appears to be a very good pious man. 
On Monday I return to town; after taking a lesson in Spanish, I dine with my dear friend Ranigonrio, and I can assure, you when I consider the many valuable friends, I have acquired in this country, and the pleasure, I enjoy in their society, I am lost in grateful acknowledgements to the Supreme for ha-ving brought me among them.
The next day I spend in learning, and call to see my friend Ichakaenyo and Shakorharatstenni, I also write to General Simcoe, letting him know my direction in case Capt. Givens should come from America; I dine with my friends Mr I_n with that pleasure I usually enjoy in the company of these good people; but when I go to hear the debates in the House of</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="203">
        <p>Commons, I find I am too late to get in, and therefore returned to my studies; and in the same employment spend the whole of the next day until afternoon, when I dine with Ranigonrio, and pass the afternoon with this amiable young man. 
The next day I breakfast with Shako-denhre and Ranigonran?non Ð this worthy gentleman honored me also with the strongest marks of friendship; he would frequently enter into conversation with me on the state of our manners and customs. What, says he, is done to the man that steals, I answered, he is obliged to restore what he stole, and it is considered as a disgrace to him; but it is rare any instance of this kind occur Ð How do they marry, continued he, they agree to live together, said I, &amp; sometimes the agreement is enter-ed into by the relations of the parties: How do they do, said he, should adultery be committed by either party, I answered should the woman transgress, the man sometimes leaves her and takes another; but when it is the man that transgresses</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="204">
        <p>separation seldom takes place; but have you no method required to prove adultery, said he, before a man may be suffered to put away his wife, I answered in the negative, Ah! returned he, had we no stronger laws I am afraid it would cause much confusion among us.
Some time after the conversation turning upon war; he said to me with an air of kindness; we must keep you here with us, and find employ for you, you must not go back to America Ð Many things did this worthy gentleman remark, among others, he said, ÒSome confide in our fleets, and armies, the excellence of our constitu-tion and equity of our laws; but I trust in the protecting arm of God, who supports the whole, and who disposes of the fates of nations Ð It is there our sins may deserve chastisement; but there is a reason to hope that the many pious people throughout the nation, who are daily glorifying his Holy name, may call forth his tender</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="205">
        <p>mercies to aid and protect us: infusing into the hearts of our warriors a heroic courage, and giving wisdom to our councils, so as render them a shield of defence to our helpless women and children.Ó
In the afternoon, I dine at Shakoya-nenhaweÕs with Shotsitciowane, and three of his amiable daughters; we pass the afternoon very agreeably. I remain there that evening: the rest of the week I spend in study Ð On Sunday I go to hear Mr Crowde preach, and in the evening go to Fulham. As usual I am receiving continual instruc-tion from the conversation of my friend: in talking of predestination, he said, I would like to know your idea on that subject, for early education frequently gives us a bias, which we follow without reflection; I replied, that in acknowledging the supremacy of God we must consequently suppose nothing can occur with-out his permission; yet his ordinances delivered to mankind for their observance acknowledges a free will in them, as also the precepts of our blessed saviour, Òknock</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="206">
        <p>and it shall be opened unto you,Ó shows some degree of capability to be admitted; but it is too intricate for me to decide on positively: yes continued my friend, and what renders the subject difficult, is that men not being sa-tisfied, with what God has been pleased to inform them, as to the means of their salvation vainly attempt to scan his heavenly councils, and these are so far above their comprehension, that they are thereby further bewildered; thus humility is the first Christian virtue, because without it, we cannot learn, nor understand the commandments and dis-pensations of God. 
I go to dine with Mr M._ and in the evening come back to my friend S_ where there is a dance; here I found as-sembled a member of beautiful ladies and agreeable gentlemen, among whom was one that is going out in a few days for Canada Ð at last the music played, and all was in movement Ð if the appearance was brilliant before, it was now increased</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="207">
        <p>by the lively figures of the dance: innocent mirth like this, it always strikes me calls forth the benevolent feelings of the heart Ð at inter-vals, when the dance ceased, a lady, who played admirably on the pianoforte, charmed us with her music: how well does the sweet voice of a female become this instrument.
The next day I returned to town and after calling on my friend Col. G_ I went to sit for a portrait to a young lady of a great genius for painting Ð this is a miniature; a portrait at full length has been taken by one of the most eminent artists in the country Ð I then went to Fleet Street, to dine with the family of my friend Ranigonrio. 
The Sunday I passed at Clapham, and on Monday, I dined with the Archbishop of York, and his family; from this venerable prelate, who is 87 years of age and his family I received every mark of civility; he converses with much firmness notwithstanding his great age, his oldest son Ad. M_ham had been in America, and as far as Niagara falls, during the time I was in the western country; our conversation turned principally on subjects relative to our country: his se-cond son who is a fine handsome, accom-plished young gentleman is I fear Col. of Dragoons Ð it was rather late when I retired. 
The next day I dined with Mr. L H_ in Lombard Street, and in the evening, went to a dance at Mr H_ts at Clapham the company I met here, was numerous and elegant; notwithstanding my inexpertness I derived great pleasure from dancing as well as from contemplating the graceful move-ments of beauty in cadence to sweet sounds. At supper the conversation turned on a lecture, that had been made at the Royal Institution, in which the Phoenicians were elevated superior to the Greeks; be-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="209">
        <p>cause they had invented the making of glass and some other useful manufactures Ð How-ever with the ladies, we unanimously agreed, that the invention of manufactures, although conducive to the comforts of life, are not to be compared to elevation and improvement of mental talents; and that the Grecian war-rior or philosopher in a hut would be superior to a Phoenician in the enjoyment of all the luxuries of his invention. 
Mr H_ one day I was at his house introduced me to S_ G_ B_ t who invited me to dine with him at a certain day. My friend Mr H_ indisposi-tion prevented him from going with me, so I went alone Ð I met there, L_ M_ ve his brother Mr P_y L_st A_ L_ L_ ne Ð the conversation turned chiefly on American subjects, as usual. And these great men by their affability and politeness soon made me feel as easy, as if we had been long acquainted. Our host and hostess, who were of the most pleasing manners, seemed humane-</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="210">
        <p>ly to interest themselves for your welfare; their politeness, and hospitality was such that we stayed until a very late hour Ð They then sent their coach with me home, where I was constrained to go being in our dress I did not like to stop at any Hotellerie; when I came there I found all asleep, and the boy slept so sound that we did not get in until my friend came and opened himself. 
The day after I dined at my friendÕs ShotsitiowaneÕs; but before I went out of town, walking down a street, that falls into Holborn, I thought I saw a person coming into it from a-nother street, that I knew; as he was behind me I declined looking more par-ticularly, until I came to the corner, where I could do it, without his taking notice, should I be mistaken Ð I there ascer-tained his figure and features to be no other than those of Mr Baudoin of the volunteers, I immediately addressed him; but I suppose his seeing me in a</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="211">
        <p>dress he had never seen me in before, was the reason, that he was some time before he recognised me Ð we walked some way together, he gave me his direction, and I gave him mine Ð I felt rejoiced to see an old acquaintance; he told me he was married, and that he had obtained a very eligible post in the East Indies, where he was going in a little time. 
After passing a pleasant day with my friend Shotsitciowane, and family; the next morning, I returned to town, and went with the Miss H_rs to Hampstead; after arriv-ing there, it being a very fine day, we took a walk on a promenade, and there I again met with my friend Baudoin, he was walking with a gentleman there.
We returned to the house, and in the garden, they showed me a bow and arrows, they had to amuse themselves with, the gardens are very pleasant and now, although it is only the beginning of April; the com-pany arrived, and we sat down to table.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="212">
        <p>This family both the ladies, and the gentle-men, are very pleasant and sociable, we passed an agreeable afternoon, the landscape scenery in this quarter is delightful. 
The next morning, I returned to town, and spent the most of my day at my studies; The ensuing day according to appointment; Mr W_ took me to dinner at Mr A_ we there met several gentlemen; - I staid so late, that on returning I found the door shut, and despairing of knocking, I went to get a bed at the George and Vulture; but was told they did not keep beds; as I did not know what taverns kept beds, I thought I would walk about until morning, and preferred the country to the town, so I walked out towards Clapham and from there to Fulham, and then to Battersea. on crossing the bridge there I found no body to open it or receive the toll, so I jumped over it, I reached Clapham Common, at the dawn of the day, and when I came to the terrace, I found Ichawendenhawightha and Icyorhen-</p>

      <div type="page" n="213">
        <p>sere were up, and at their studies, they per-ceived me, and let me in Ð I did not ima-gine, I was sleepy, until I sat down to study, when I was soon overpowered with drowsiness, and was constrained to sleep, before I could make any further attempt. 
I made enquiry that I might know where to go, another time, and I learnt that the Humhums was a place, where a bed could be got at any time of night. I dined at S_ G_ B_tÕs with a few of his friends, and in the evening we went to join a party at Mrs _ C_wÕs there I met several principal gentlemen. Mr W_m Mr Sp_r, a lively entertain-ing young gentleman, ever abounding in wit &amp; humor, after conversing about an hour we retired; - I then went and got a bed at the humhums Ð in the morning I set off for Clapham, where I spent the day and dined there with my friend and his family, meeting also there Mrs and Miss Icron-nohen;</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="214">
        <p>The next morning I walked to Fulham to dine with my friend S_ I also slept there, and in the morning returning to town, I accompanied Shakoriwawase to dine at a friends house in the neigh-borhood of Deptford. I there met a numerous company, among whom were many pious men, we passed the afternoon very agree-ably, and at evening a coach was sent with me to Clapham to the house of Rorighwag?ron. I slept there and also passed the next day being Sunday; my amiable friend RanigonraÕsnore also joined us there. 
The next day my much esteemed friend RanigonÕrio, took me to Mitch-am; we there passed Ð the day pleasantly with his excellent parents, and amiable sister, also another gentleman and lady who by their pleasing manners added much to the happy satisfaction we felt Ð the next day we pass in viewing the farm of my friend, until I sat down to write this Adieu</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="215">
        <p>London, May 15, 1808.
My Dear friend, 
At the conclusion of the last, I said, that I had spent the day in taking a view of my friendÕs farm, it is arranged very neat and he pays attention to it, rather for amusement than profit, and do you not think agriculture one of the most rational amuse-ments, as well as the first of arts, &amp; that which supports all others. 
The next day we went to town to-gether, and I had the pleasure of dining with two eminent ladies, at his house; greatly cele-brated for their literary talents, piety and benevolence, I shall call them Kare-w?notons and Yak?sny?se: their conversa-tion was both edifying and pleasing Ð In the evening I parted with them to go to Clap-ham to meet the son of Col. Barilay of New York at Sho-tsiciowaneÕs; his Grand Father I have been told was mis-sionary to the Mohawks, and it was he I think that translated the prayer book. he is a fine young gentleman and has a commission in the dragoons.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="216">
        <p>The next day we dined at the house of Shakoyanenhawe, with several friends, among which was a gentleman of a great fund of humor, and vivacity, who enlivened the conversation with repeated sallies. 
A day or two after, I called upon Iho-nighway?ri, it was not long since, he had returned from his country seat, it give me great pleasure to see him, and after the usual salutation, he said; well, have you had any success, have you been able to do any thing for the Five Nations? I replied that so far from having done any thing, I had even lost all hopes of making any impression; Well returned he, I having found Mr S and he says, that he has the necessary papers; you can see him at the Crown Picadilly, he is surprised, that he had not heard from you, since you have been in England, I told him you had wrote; but he says he never received your letter. He then in-vited me to dinner on Saturday, and I retired.- but immediately went to call upon Mr S ; I found him at the Hotel</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="217">
        <p>after saluting each other, he said, that he thought he had a copy of Gen. HaldimandÕs grant to the Five Nations, at his house in Wiltshire, where he would return in a few days, and would not delay to trans-mit it to me. in the course of the conversation, in making enquiries after IÕhayendan?gen, he expressed great regret that he had not allowed, one of his sons to go to England to be educated, for, said he, had he done that, it might have tended to destroy rumors, that have been spread to the detriment of his character, as a steady loyalist; and that once, he had persuaded him to send his son, but he suspected an American he saw with him had again dissuaded him from it. 
I replied, that I was sorry to hear, that re-ports of such a nature, had even received any atten-tion; because they did not appear to me to have any real foundation; unless that the careless exclamations of a man in a state of inebriety &amp; offended with some of the officers of government; can just-ly be taken as proof of his disloyalty Ð when on the other hand he neither makes preparation, nor is he in a situation to</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="218">
        <p>injure the government. I then took farewel, 
I accompanied my friend again to Mitcham, I now met there, Rarwnotons, and Yak?snyise; who filled with joy the minds of our amicable hosts; the whole was both an edifying, and delightful society. These deservedly respected ladies have with care and industry improved their mental faculties, which are very superior Ð their countenances give strong expression of piety, energy and dignity of sentiment. They seemed by their questions to take an interest in your welfare.
When I returned to town from this delightful abode, I went to dine with Ihorighwayer, I then had the honor of being introduced to his amiably noble family, I also met there a friend of his Ð the grandeur of the buildings, the number of the attendants and richness of their attire; that administer to this noble friend of the Five Nations, would dazzle you, the appartments are so many, that when I enter, I always have to consider, how I am to get out again,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="219">
        <p>without blundering: and if this grandeur excites admiration, the humanity and affability of the noble owner will create in the breasts of those who know him the warmest sentiments of friendship and regard. 
Some days after, I went to Feltham hill to see Onondio, it was eight months since I had been there Ð I found, he had moved to Sunbury, on account of an indisposition he had felt during the winter, the Physicians had advised him to change situation Ð I had the pleasure of seeing this gentleman perfect-ly restored to his health again, and we met with mutual friendly congratulations at seeing each other again. 
This gentleman, since I first became acquainted with him at the Beach on Lake Ontario, I have respected both for his talents and probity, he acquired in Canada some enemies, who because they have no reason for their enmity, are doubtless determined ever to retain it Ð And with their usual fondness of representing those they have a personal aversion to, as inimical and dangerous to government; so they have</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="220">
        <p>rumored that this gentleman was endea-voring to form intrigues to the detriment of Government Ð When I observe people at variance, and I feel unprejudiced to either party, these that I perceive first to support their cause by falshood, I judge to be in the wrong. That this is false as to his attempting any thing by intrigue among the tribes here, you know as well as I, and I dont doubt, but it will strike you with surprise that they should have fallen upon such an accu-sation; I can tell you the grounds on which they form it Ð a surveyor that had been surveying his lands in Wyndham, came to the Grand River a little before my departure for Albany on the Caghnawaga [DR16]business Ð I heard him speak to Ihayendanegen [DR17]respecting Onondio; and either by his description of the man, or through his advice, he determined to visit him; which he set out to do, when I began my journey: On arriving there, as he afterwards told me,</p>

        <p>he was struck with a sympathetic feeling to see a man of the rank of Onondio driven from his native country, for having shown a faithful attachment to his lawful sovereign, and looking for an asylum under the protection of his Majesty, find no better situation than that where he was placed; - he therefore proposed that the Missisagues might relinquish a part of their lands from the head of the Lake Ontario to the twelve Mile Creek, to ac-comodate the French loyalists, and that Onondio should obtain the confirm-ation from the British Government. He undoubtedly having just come from Europe, could have no idea, that it would be deemed criminal for the Aborigins to dispose of their lands in favor of those they pleased Ð and if there was any intri-gue in the business, I do not think he knew any thing of it Ð Ihayendanegen then pressed him to return the visit, which he did Ð but on hearing the great noise made about it Ð he never</p>

In his private character at Nia-gara, he was industrious and benevolent, although retired Ð in this country he is the same, he has bought a small farm, and amuses himself in its cultivation, and in the improvement of barren lands: if the poor in his neighborhood are sick, he visits them, and does to them all the good in his power Ð he is religious and temperate Ð an admirer of the con-stitution and laws of England, and has become a British subject.</p>

        <p>While I was here, I passed the forenoon in studying, while he was writing his memoirs: and in the afternoon we amused ourselves in conversation &amp; in the pleasures of a prome-nade and in listening to the delightful notes of the nightingale. One day we went to see a fair that was held a few miles off Ð here farmers drovers and merchants brought for sale, horses cattle and mer-chandize; and buyers went from the neighboring villages and perhaps some from a greater distance to seek the things they were in want of. 
We returned to Sunbury by a different road from which we had taken in going, that led along the pleasant banks of the Thames, through a country beautiful from nature, and improved by the highest state of cultivation; two days after I take leave of my friends to return to town, promising to come back to them in a few days, and join in a party to visit Windsor, the summer residence of His Majesty.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="224">
        <p>I passed through the pleasant park of Richmond, every object is now enlivened by the beautiful verdure of Spring, the luxuriant herbage pushing forth on the fertile meadows, for nouriture to the animals designed for the use of man, and the thick foliage produced by the wide spreading branches of the lofty trees that decorate the parks and walks offering to the traveller a refreshing shelter from the sunÕs vertical rays. 
After a very pleasant walk, I arrive at Clapham, and call at the house of my worthy friend Shotsiciowane, I saw again with great pleasure this much esteemed family, and was happy to find that I met their intentions, that I should make a visit to their country house at B_ H_ [DR18]and two days after, I accompanied there my amicable young friend Ichawenden-hawightha, we rode through a beauti-</p>

      <div type="page" n="225">
        <p>ful country in Surry, ornamented in a delight-ful manner with farms villages and gentlemenÕs villaÕs, we passed through Dorkin, and arrived at B_ H_ a little before Sunset, this house is situate on the so side of a Hill covered with a chiefly of fir wood, which though a dark shade of beauty, yet when taken all together, with a pretty verdant lawn, and fine piece of water in the front containing an island, on the other side of which are si-tuate fine meadows interspersed with green trees, form a charming landscape. But the pleasure of the scene was in-terrupted by an unforeseen misfortune: the daughter in law of my worthy friends had been taken ill, and the anxiety all were in for the safety of this beloved object of their care, damped our inclinations for contemplating the beauties of a rural scene, by leading us to reflect on the many unfortunate incidents with which</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="226">
        <p>the life of mortals is chequered Ð we were however cheered by appearances with the hopes of a speedy recovery.
The next day, I went to church in Dorking, which is a country town; however its population would entitle it to the name of a city in our country Ð On Monday several gentlemen in the neighborhood called upon my friend; and the next day, we did ourselves the pleasure of calling upon them Ð their houses are delightfully situated and ornamented with the most exquisite taste: but I could not avoid observing that there are tracts of excellent land, of which little use is made, otherwise than that of forming a beautiful landscape, these are called pleasure grounds; and it must be some loss in a country so very populous as this is; yet there is no remedy for it except a change of taste in the gentry.</p>

      <div type="page" n="227">
        <p>When they come to look upon a field of grain, or a luxuriant meadow, to be as pleasing to the eye, as it is profitable for its productions for the sustenance of man, the thing is effected. 
The pleasantest place I saw here is the seat of Mr Peters, to whom I had the honor of having been previously introduced by Mr Hoare Ð we were in considerable time with this gentleman walking through his parks, and viewing his house, with which as well as with the pleasing manners &amp; conversation of this gentleman and his family we were much charmed.
The next day I returned to Sun-bury; according to promise, and the day after, we took our trip to Windsor, we met on the road our beloved Sove-reign, and some of the Princes, they were followed by a party of the Oxford blues, a fine regiment of horse so called.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="228">
        <p>The road through which we passed is beau-tiful in the extreme, all around giving de-monstrations of the most exact husbandry, and active industry, the fields everywhere promising a copious harvest, except where the prevailing taste had turned them into a charming wilderness Ð whenever we approached the winding and fertile banks of the Thames the admiration at the delightful land-scape was increased: The mind thus enchanted with the variety of the most exquisite beauties of inanimate nature, we imperceptibly arrive at Windsor. 
We leave our horses at the Hotel, where we cause a dinner to be prepared, while we go to view the curiosities of this ancient royal citadel. It is situate on a commanding eminence so that from the turrets of the castle may be seen 14 counties, there being no hills of any height to interrupt the view,</p>

      <div type="page" n="229">
        <p>rather than the great elevation of the place is the cause of this extensive prospect, the diversified and beautiful scenes of which fill the mind with rapture. 
In the castle are two rooms commu-nicating with each other in which were confined three hundred years ago the Kings of France and Scotland, who had both been taken prisoners in a war that was highly glorious to the English nation, from the courage and conduct they therein displayed. There is here much ancient arms and armour, the sight of which gives an idea of the rapid progress they made in the arts the three centuries past Ð the match lock guns are a very simple, and plain piece of workmanship Ð and a great sword of an ancient warrior famed for strength and courage, has no greater appearance of skill in its</p>

From here we went into the chapel, in it several valiant knights have monuments: we then returned to the Hotel took our dinner; our horses were brought up, and we rode back to Feltham Hill and Sunbury.</p>

        <p>London, June 15, 1804
Dr Friend, 
Leaving Sunbury, I came to Town, where I had the pleasure of again seeing my friends, in a few days my friend Ranigon-rio took me to Mitcham, where I passed a few days very pleasantly, and on returning to town, I again went to Berry Hill, there I found all in the enjoyment of health, and of the rural pleasures, which this delightful si-tuation affords. From a little rise a few hun-dred yards from the house, is a delightful pros-over a fine country neatly cultivated, and so ornamented with trees as to give it a very appearance. 
The pond was also a fund of amuse-ment, there being a neat little boat on it Ð we sometimes sailed, and rowed round it Ð walk-ed over the neighboring meadows, and fields, visited the neighboring gentlemen. On Sun-day I went to Woolan Church, where the Rev. Mr Taylor preached; the next day we viewed his grounds, and in the afternoon had the pleasure of his company together</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="232">
        <p>with the Bishop of Chichester all breath be-nevolence, and kindness towards you, and an eager desire to have Christian know-ledge propagated among you. 
I rode to town with my friend Shakoyanenhawe, and soon after my arrival went to see Shakoratstenni, and to Clapham to see my friends there, who I had the pleasure to find well. I met at my excellent friendÕs Shakodenhre, Lord B_m, this worthy gentleman is near eighty years of age; yet does he retain full vigor of mind, and yet lives to aid his King and country with his abilities; while I am here, and with Ichakaenyon, I frequently have the pleasure of meeting my friend Ranigonraghsnore, he acquaints me that His Majesty is to review the Volunteers, and corps of yeomanry of the country of Surry, and I agree to accompany my friend when he goes to be received.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="233">
        <p>We leave Clapham early in the morning, breakfast with the Ranigonrio, and proceed to Epsom, where the review was to take place Ð about an hour after our arrival the volunteers form, they make a very martial appearance Ð the King ar-rives and they pass in review before him, after performing very correctly many military evolutions, they consisted of about three thousand foot and eight hundred horse. 
In the evening we return to Mitcham, where we sleep Ð the next morning I walk through some beautiful meadows to Carshalton to the house of Ick-nawadeghkwen, his family were well; but I had not the pleasure of seeing himself Ð I return to Mitcham and pass the day with my amicable friends. When I get to town again I call upon my noble friend Ihorighwayer, and after some conversation on your affairs, finding that Mr T had been mistaken, and that he had no papers with him, which could be of any service to</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="234">
        <p>your affairs, he advised me to call upon Lord Dorchester and I asked him for a few of lines of introduction, which he favored me with. I went that way immediately, His LordshipÕs place of re-sidence is a few miles from Windsor on passing Sunbury my friend Onondio gave me a horse to ride, and I passed through the pleasant road I have already described, and beyond Wind-sor, the beauty of the scene continued. yet there is some variety, for I saw many cultivated fields without inclo-sure, this is very general in some parts of England Ð the cattle are put in pasture, that is inclosed; or fed with cut grass.
I arrived at the seat of His Lord-ship on the edge of a heath, he enquired kindly after you all Ð and observed that it could not be possible, that the Grant of General Haldimand could</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="235">
        <p>be disputed, the intention of it being so clear, and that he thought out apprehensions were without just foundation, he however promised that should he be inquired of for in-formation, he would assert that the real intention of the Grant was to give the land to the Five Nations and their posterity forever. this was as much as I could require, I therefore thanked His Lordship and retired. 
I returned to Sunbury, that even-ing Ð and the next morning went to town, I acquainted Ihorighwayer with the suc-cess, I had met with, and he seemed to think it sufficient Ð my other friends were also very happy to find, that His Lordship retained so clear a recol-lection of the business. Shakodenrhe Icakaenyo and all were ready to assist every thing in their power. 
A Petition was drawn up, and Lord Camden graciously pro-mised to lay it before the Privy Council.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="236">
        <p>All congratulated me on the fair prospect there was of obtaining for you what I had so much at heart Ð I dined with Seronhhenh, there was there a great company and among them many of my old acquaintance and warm friends. The evening was passed very pleasantly the charms of conversation, music, beau-ty and friendship all enlivened the scene. 
When the evening was advanced my friend Shakoyanenhawe retired with me to his house, and the next day, I dined there with a party of friends. I afterward dined at the George and vulture with Shotsitciowane, Roty?nighton and their friends Ð the day after, I prepare for another trip to Berry Hill, and from there to Albury, to a fete Cham-ptre, that is to be given, you see that the kind hospitallity of my friends, causes me to enjoy a continual suc-cession of festivity.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="237">
        <p>Before going to Berry Hill, I have an invitation to dine with Ichaghnawateghhwen with some friends at this house at Carshal-ton Ð I accompany there Ichawenndenha-wightha; and we pass a very pleasant day, with this worthy and hospitable gentleman and his amiable family. 
This gentleman with his holhen carries on the bleach-ing business to a very great extent, to faci-litate which, they have entirely subjected to this command a pleasant stream, that passes through their grounds, which entitles I_ without dispute to the name he bears in our tribe. The convenient arrangement, made for this business is so great, that linnin is sent even from Ireland to be bleached here, although in that country labor is much more cheap than in England.
The active principle which urges most English gentlemen to apply them-selves to some business, strikes me as a</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="238">
        <p>source of wealth and power to the nation, that will continue to increase so long as they are actuated by this spirit of activity. When the rich are so infatuated, as to think of doing nothing but to wallow in luxury and enjoy the pleasures of sense, they are a dead weight to their country, or if they are any thing else, it is the source of corruption; even those who are em-ployed in administering to their luxury, or to their pleasure are so many hands taken from useful labor. 
It is perhaps the want of activity and entreprize in the rich men of Spain, rather than the extent of its colonies, that has been the cause of the decline of that nation. And the opposite character in those of England, has had the contrary effect.
It is these alone, who are able to ex-pend money in rendering fertile, barren waste land, in laying the foundation of extensive manufactures on improved plans, and to wait patiently for the returns, they may receive from the profits</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="239">
        <p>there from arising. The industrious poor can undertake no enterprize, in which they may be a long time, before they receive the profits derived from their labor; because it is on these they subsist Ð It is therefore from the support of the virtuous rich, that this numerous class of people become useful members of society; and in proportion that they are supported in advancing useful works, so will a nation increase in population, in riches and in power.
In extensive nations like those of Europe, the number of those who are employed in managing the political concerns of the state, are small in proportion to the great mass of principal people, when that part of them, who are left to attend to their pri-vate concerns, apply their talents and their purses to the improvement of lands and extension of commerce, they become in advancing their private fortunes, the principal supporters of their country.

        <p>Portsmouth 20th Aug. 1804
Dear friend.
After concluding my last I went to Berry Hill; we had there the pleasure of my friendsÕ company Ichaghnawateghhwen, Ichawennden-hawightha &amp; Icyorhensere, after re-galing ourselves some days in the con-templation of the surrounding beauties of nature, and in friendly conversation; proceeded on the day appointed to the Fte, which was held in a wood a small distance from Albury Park; but just as I was on the eve of entering a coach, I received a letter, which gave me many unpleasing re-flections Ð it acquainted me with dis-patches having been received from Ca-nada, giving information to the Go-vernment, that you disapprove, and disallow of all my proceedings here on your behalf Ð I could not drive this</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="241">
        <p>sufficiently from my mind, it was covered with a gloom, that rendered me insensible to every pleasure Ð I felt convinced not-withstanding, that there has been some deception in this transaction, yet it has come to Government through such a a [DR19]channel, as obliges them to attend to it, at least until we elucidate the business.
I passed through Albury park, and stopped a little at the house before we proceeded. the scene was very different from what it was at the time I was here before, when the trees stript of their foliage showed only bare branches through which the wind whistled, and the flowers and herbs of the field had all withered away. Now every thing was in the highest bloom, and imagination can hardly surpass the gaiety and beauty of the scenery. 
We assembled on the side of a hill covered with wood, all the gentry of the neighborhood were</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="242">
        <p>invited, and a great part of them were there, the assembly was both numerous and brilliant. 
Lots were drawn for partners, a circle was formed on the green, and the lively dance commenced. The appear-ance was elegantly rural, and the charms of the whole was heightened by the num-ber of ladies present, whose personal beauty brightened in the dance, as their pure and enlightened minds enriched the conversation.
But all was ineffectual to dissi-pate the disagreeable gloom, that involved my mind; which seemed to disturb me the more, when I could see no means of combating this attack with hopes of success, until I recross the Atlantic. At last it was requested of me to dance the war dance; and indeed this seemed to be the only thing, that suited the state in which I then found my mind. It was with pleasure therefore I accepted of the proposal.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="243">
        <p>The dance concluded we adjourned to a barn, where the tables were set for dinner, after sitting a considerable time, prepara-tions were made for dancing; and in a little time the barn was all in a move, at a tolerable late hour we broke up, and returned to Berry Hill. 
Notwithstanding the lateness of the night I travelled with as much speed and security as in the day, the roads are made and kept in such good order for car-riages, (scribbled out lines). At Five o clock in the morning; Icha-wendenhawightha, and myself we return-ed to town. 
I then called upon Thorighwayer and acquainted him with this intelligence, his benevolence I could perceive was affected with it; but what could we do there was no remedy on this side</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="244">
        <p>the water, until we can prove the informa-tion given by the dispatches to be ill-founded. 
 In the evening I returned to Clapham where with my young friends Ichawendenhawight-ha and Tayorhensere I amused myself on the green, until Shotsitciowane came in Ð The next day, I called on my dear friend Shako-denrhe, and acquainted him with the circum-stance Ð AlthoÕ I entertained no hopes of doing any thing for you after this, yet I thought it incumbent on me, to state the reasons, I had for my conduct. 
I now gave up hopes of revisiting Cambridge, as I had intended before I heard this news Ð I only thought of returning home, or of going to war should any ex-pedition be undertaken Ð In the mean time, I meet at ShakodenrheÕs A_ G_ this excellent gentleman had shown himself a warm friend, since the first time, I had the pleasure of being known to him Ð he is as mild and</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="245">
        <p>humane at home as he is brave, when he meets the enemies of his country. In the company of these worthy gentlemen, the sensations I had at first felt began to weak-en. 
Some days after I receive a letter from Shakodenhrhe, informing me that L_ B_ had written to him, that there was a frigate going to Quebec, in which I might get a passage, should I wish to return, and that he thought in the present circumstances, it was the best I could do, I did not hesitate about what part I was to take; but immediately began to prepare to recross the Atlantic.
I can hardly tell which feeling operated the most strongly in my mind, the joy I presented of seeing you shortly again, or the sorrow I felt at leaving my worthy friends here, by whom I had been honored with so many sincere tokens of friendship, that in contemp-lating their piety, their virtue and their knowledge I ever felicitated myself on having been so</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="246">
        <p>fortunate, as to find such friends, and must we henceforth be separated by the briny flood, said I, from these excellent people in the society of whom, I have had so much felicity. 
In the mean time my friend S_ returned from Cambridge, I received great pleasure in seeing him again, and in hearing of their friendly dispositions towards me. After a few days he presented me with a kind letter on their part, and a purse of sixty guineas also my friend Shakodenhrhe, on the part of himself and friends, gave me forty five guineas, and a printing press, which when I can have leisure, I intend to use in print-ing things, for the use of our growing youth. Thus did it please God, that the generosity of my friends, furnished me abundantly wherewithal for my journey to you again.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="247">
        <p>Some time before this bad news had arrived, when my friend Ranigonrio was going to the West, I promised, that if I could, I would not leave England, until he returned Ð I felt a sincere re-gret, that it was now out of my power to keep my word, and that I must now leave England without again seeing this ami-cable gentleman. 
Before I left London, I yet had the pleasure of another short sejour, with my worthy friend Shotsitciowa-ne, in the country Ð I had the pleasure to see my friend Ichaka-nyo return before I left London. At least the day arrived, I was to leave town, and to take perhaps the last farewell of these worthy friends, to whom my heart was bound so strong by gratitude and friendship. 
I passed by the house of Shakoyan-enhave, and that far I was conducted by my benevolent friend Rakhidnron, with whom I parted with the deepest regret Ð Thus is ever earthly felicity turned into grief,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="248">
        <p>If the pleasure and satisfaction we enjoy in the company of a friend we re-gard be great, so is the sorrow we feel on a separation, particularly when there is the greatest probability of not meeting again Ð Then and then only will the bliss of the just be complete, when they meet before Him, who is the source of all good.
I breakfasted with my friends Ihakoyanenhawe, and Ichawennndenha-wightha, and then we parted, they went towards the city, and I went towards the West Ð Before arriving at Fulham I met a gentleman, I had seen with Sha-korharatstenn, he told me the troops that were going out under our convoy were already embarked, and that it was likely the fleet would sail the first fair wind Ð I saluted my much esteem-ed friend Sh_ and his charming family Ð and went on my journey Ð On coming to Onondio, he prevailed on me to stop, that evening, he had</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="249">
        <p>not yet wrote his letters Ð and promised to send along with me his black man and a horse across the country at day light the next morning Ð As soon as it dawned I arose, and found him preparing, in a few minutes we started, and passed across the country on byeroads, there being no high way in a direct course Ð a little after breakfast we came to Berry Hill Ð I there saw my dear friend Shotsitciow-ane, and his amiable family, after passing about an hour with them, on every minute of which I set a value, the post chaise came, and I got in &amp; said farewell.
I stopped at the beautiful Park of Albury to bid adieu to the mother and sisters of Ranigonraghsnore; with whom I had parted some time before at London, when he set out on a journey to the North of Europe Ð I heard here, that he was safe arrived in Sweden. They caused me to take a copper plate of the man-sion and park to keep in remembrance</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="250">
        <p>of my friends, which I did. Although I had no need, for I am assured, that the sensa-tions of friendship and gratitude, I feel will never let me forget them; let the space that separates us be ever so wide. I took farewell and proceeded, never stopping except to change horses all the way to Portsmouth Ð When I came to where the roads separate, that lead to this place, and to where my friend the brother of Ranigonrio resides: I wish-ed to go to see him; but the apprehend-sion of the fleet sailing, obliged me to hasten Ð I arrived at Portsmouth at the dusk of the evening; after I had learnt the Captain of the frigate was in town, I called upon him, and gave him a letter from L_ B_m and another from A_ G_ r_ he is a fine handsome, polite and brave young gentleman, carrying on his body the honorable seals he has received in the service of his King and country.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="251">
        <p>Portsmouth derives its chief importance from its excellent harbor, which perhaps to-gether with the convenience of the situation is the cause of the great wort of the British Navy to this place: here also is made the princi-pal part of the embarkations of troops for foreign parts. Except the support this place receives from the Navy and army, there is apparently little trade here to furnish employ for the inhabitants. The fortifications and dock yards are extensive. 
After ten oÕ clock, I called upon A_ M_w with a letter I had from Sharihowanen to him; he is a fine handsome gentleman polite frank, and brave; he was acquainted with some of the Shawanons, whom he had seen in Virginia many years ago Ð I received from him an invitation to dinner the next day; previous to which I visited Gosport on the other side the harbor, got the press put on board, for to facilitate which the Captain obligingly sent his long boat.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="252">
        <p>In the evening taking a promenade on the ramparts, I was much delighted with the music of the marines. This is a body of troops, that are disciplined, and do duty like others when on shore; but they occasionally serve on board of ship, every ship of war, in proportion to her rate, having a detachment of them. 
There I met the Captain, and his Lady Ð also her sister and brother Ð they asked me to pass the evening with them, which I did with much pleasure. I find this gentleman pleasant and agreeable, which gives me a favorable omen of an agreeable voyage. 
The next day, I spend the forenoon in bathing, and in walking about, and in the afternoon, I go to dinner with the A_ who introduces me to his lady and daughters; and several Captains, among which was my friend with whom I was to cross the Atlantic. The conversation was pleasant and lively, some of these gentlemen had made the circuit of the globe, and all had fought the enemies of their country.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="253">
        <p>A hardy air of fortitude and determined courage tempered with modesty strongly prepossesses me in favor of the officers of the British Navy Ð they look like the great actions they perform. 
I retired along with a worthy Captain to the Fountain, where we both put up, and in conversing on the times, and the premeditated in-vasion, I alleged that I could not agree with some people, in considering it as an enterprize impossible to be effected by the enemy; yet I strongly suspected that he might defer the attempt in hopes of finding the nation less prepared than they are at present, for that reason, they should make it a point to be indefatigable in preparations of defence; keeping a respectable force of regulars in readiness, improving fortify-cations, and perfecting, as much as possible their volunteer system; for that although the British Navy were so infinitely superior in every respect, that the French could not give them battle with any hopes of success, yet they might be content to suffer a defeat, if they could by that means</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="254">
        <p>gain time for their flotilla to cross; but that should the state of defence be such as to baulk this invading army in their ex-pectations of success, and to reward their temerity in invading the British shore by a thorough overthrow; the loss of their fleet and army would certainly oblige the French to ask for peace, or to continue the war with great disadvantage, and without having the means of striking a blow. This gentleman, observed, that every thing might be expected from the courage of the army; but that there was a few general officers of ability &amp; experience, equal to wielding a great military force; and that it was to be regretted, the system of promotion did not give much room to hope for an improvement. 
We bid each other good night and after reading a little I retired to rest Ð meditating on the unpleasant feelings I would have should an invasion take place, after I was gone.</p>

        <p>As we only waited for a fair wind, and the orders of the Admiralty for sailing, I could not venture to go into the country to see my friend, although he was only about twenty miles distant Ð for the one might become favorable in an instant, and the other might be conveyed from London by means of the telegraph in a few minutes. 
This invention although lately disco-vered, is very simple at the same time that it is of the greatest importance, in conveying commands with secrecy and dispatch. It is thus, at the top of the Admiral-ty house, certain figures are shown, which are repeated at the next telegraph on the line to which it is directed, and so in succession, until it arrives at the place intended Ð the mean-ing of the figures is only known at the Admi-ralty and by the commandants of posts, the telegraph keepers only act in imitation Ð these are generally placed at visible dis-tances on rising grounds, when such are to be found. 
In this situation separate from my friends; but not advancing towards you,</p>

      <div type="page" n="256">
        <p>I felt everything but tranquility; the books that at other times have diverted me, have now no charms to attract my attention; some-times I think of you, at other times the va-luable friends I am now leaving, together with the idea of their piety their virtue their pa-triotism, their integrity, their benevolence and the many noble and good qualities they possess, engross my mind; from these reflections, as it were, becoming more in-terested in the welfare of the whole, I am led to contemplate the present situation of Great Britain, standing between the Emperor of the French, and universal dominion Ð for it is she alone that will effectually oppose him, the other nations of Europe seem to fall at his feet, and should they be prevailed on to take up the hatchet of war, I am apprehensive that they will use it with so little energy, as only to give additional glory to his arms, by their discomfiture; for had they really been animated with the spirit of inde-</p>

        <p>pendence, they would have been the first to have begun the combat, as by their proximity they are the most materially interested in the issue of the contest, they would not have waited for exportation or pecuniary aid from another quarter. 
And in contemplating the present, I was led to observe the steps, by which great Britain has arrived at her grandeur, and superiority, and to trace in some measure the cause. Great Britain appears to have risen to the height of power she now enjoys rather by the extension of her commerce, the improvement and increase of her manu-factures, and the excellence of her consti-tution, which perhaps in a great degree has nourished and encouraged the other, the conquests she has made in distant parts have rather been intended to protect and enlarge her commerce, than to extend her dominions. And if the nations of Europe have witnessed the prowess of her warriors, it has been to protect the weak, and sus-tain the balance of power, not to extend her dominions.</p>

      <div type="page" n="258">
        <p>As in a man a good constitution is neces-sary to sustain fatigue, and support the body, under violent exertions Ð so in a na-tion a good constitution is no less requisite, to enable it at home to dispel tyranny or anarchy, and to afford protection and secu-rity to all its members Ð and at the time when foreign danger threatens, to combine the force of the whole, so as to oppose it with steadiness and energy. But the constitution of man fails at the end of a certain number of years Ð that of a nation has no particular period to its ex-istence, it may be broken in its infancy, and it may have gained additional vigor in old age; so long as there remains a great proportion of virtue in the com-munity it rests secure; This is to it a healing balsam, that so long, as it is plentifully supplied, preserves, it from decay and disease; but vice is a cancer, that, if it once takes hold, will secretly gnaw its vitals.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="259">
        <p>The constitution of Great Britain seems admirably calculated for a nation of its extent. and the national temper appears well adapted to preserve such a constitution. It gives pro-tection and freedom to the subject, and energy and force to the executive. 
The Executive power is vested in the King, he chooses the Members of his Council; but in this choice he is apparently influenced by the sense of the Nation; for those who compose it are for the most part, men of considera-tion in the country, and of weight in parlia-ment. 
The Legislative power is possessed by the two houses of Parliament, the house of Lords, and the house of Commons. The first is composed of the nobles descended from those of ancient times, and these that have since been added to the peerage by successive Kings. The Commons are the represent-atives of the people, chosen respectively by the shires and boroughs, and consist of upwards of six hundred members for e/y United Kingdoms. They are chosen every seven years, and at any time the King pleases to dissolve parliament.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="260">
        <p>Every law that is enacted must first pass the two houses, and receive the Royal assent Ð The Executive can make war; but they must ask of the two houses, supplies wherewith to carry it on Ð The parlia-ment always treat with sacred respect the venerable name of Majesty; but they call to an account for the conduct of the Executive, those who compose his council, called his Ministers; they also call an account of expenditures, when they suspect any misapplication of the pub-lic monies Ð In short this Government seems to be a mixture of Monarchy, and Republicanism in which the princi-ples of e/u latter most prevail, and the King appears to bind the whole fabric more firmly together, he is like the point at which the national strength is con-centrated.
I cannot however consider these three branches of government as exactly distinct and independent of each other; for it appears that in the house of Commons, the King</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="261">
        <p>has influence, the leadings characters in the country have also weight there, and some circumstances induce me to think, that the general sense of the nation is also taken into consideration by many Ð thus in the house there appears a mixture of Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy. The House of Lords may also be variously influenced. And it is very evident, that the King and Council have great consi-deration for what may be the general sense of the house touching their admin-istration; so all the branches seem to be compounds of the above stated in-gredients. 
This from what I can observe, seems to be the outlines of the British consti-tution, and although complicate and in-definable in theory; yet has proved itself excellent in practice Ð The other nations of Europe had nearly the same foundation left them by their ancestors to build on; but it required the spirit of Englishmen, to form and maintain in purity such an admirable system.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="262">
        <p>Perhaps the same temperament, that has given rise to, and continues to preserve the excellence of the constitution, is also the guardian of justice, and causes the laws in this country to be administered with less partiality than in any other country known, These are very complicate; but I believe they always incline to equity; and when by chicanery the letter of the law in any ways covers injustice, there is what they call, the Court of Chancery, which drives injustice from its covert and decides according to equity Ð
The method of trial, although simple, and a custom left to them by their unculti-vated ancestors, is admirably calculated to shield innocence from unjust condem-nation Ð The criminal is tried by this country Ð The Attorneys[DR20] plead for and against, before the jury, who are twelve men chosen from among the creditable inhabitants, the prisoner can object to twenty without assigning any reason for his objection, and as many more</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="263">
        <p>as he can give reason for. The evidences are summed up, and when the Attornies [DR21]on both sides have sufficiently spoken on the subject Ð The Judge gives the charge to the jury, who are all sworn to decide justly to the best of their judg-ment Ð they retire and are shut up until they agree, when they return they give their verdict, guilty or not guilty. And according to this verdict sentence is passed. The voice of mercy is reserved for the King, but notorious offenders he seldom pardons. 
This system I am sure you will agree is excellent; but then it requires men of Spirit and integrity, with an innate love of justice, that can animate them to do, and say what their conscience approves, let who will frown; to put it in execution. And happy for England she possesses many such Ð without them her laws would be no better than waste paper, and her constitution idle forms: For what advantage would it be for a</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="264">
        <p>criminal to be tried by a jury, if that jury were more afraid of his powerful enemies, than they were of their God.
Englishmen are characteristically indepen-dent in their sentiments, at the same time, that their sympathetic feelings are very strong, and by these they are urged to espouse with warmth the cause of the injured. Perhaps this dispo-sition was the cause, why England in ancient times produced so many knights famous in the annals of chivalry. 
Gentlemen of talents and learning are far removed from having any thing of the assuming in their character; and althoÕ the goods of fortune may be necessary here, to an independent and comfortable living, as they are in all civilized communities; yet a man of character may have the happiness to acquire the esteem, and friendship of men of the highest rank, and talents; without ever being asked the extent of his estate or the amount of his income: unless it might be from a generous motive of aiding him, in any difficulties he might labor under on that account.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="265">
        <p>In great Britain, the learned seem to have acquired the greatest proficiency in science of any other country in the world. And in improvements to promote the comforts of life there is no nation equal. The gentle-men, in general as I have already mentioned are ac-tive, either serving their country in the Senate or the field, in the church or at the bar, in applying themselves to improvements in agriculture or extension of commerce. 
People of business although industrious have not the least appearance of parsimony, and yet notwithstanding the Hollanders with all their economy and frugality have been out done by the active enterprize of Britons. I have read some where, and I believe from what little I have seen that there is much truth in the observa-tion Ð That in Germany, they will ask when they see a stranger, if he is noble, in Holland if he is rich; but in England they only ask what kind of man he is.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="266">
        <p>You may already have perceived in what I have wrote, that hospitality and generous friendship abound to a great degree in this country: Religion also finds many warm and sincere votaries; and even those whose eagerness in worldly pursuits has led them to regard her with indifference, yet they treat her with respect: few I believe are so profligate as to dare to revile her. 
The middle and higher classes of people and perhaps the whole preass in some parts of the country, are patriotic and brave to the highest degree, and I think would strain every nerve in defence of their country against foreign invasion Ð The same people that are always blaming the administration, would also risk their property and lives in defence of their King and country; and perhaps the readiness to blame and to defend may both proceed from the same cause; namely the interest every one takes in the welfare of his country, and preservation of the constitution.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="267">
        <p>In a country governed by the despotic sway, an invader is only opposed by the resources, which the despot is able to extort from his slaves; and unless when the may be possessed of extra-ordinary talents to render himself beloved; they in general take no great interest in the contest; for let the worst take place it is only changing masters. But in a free country like England, the people are led by affection to regard their sovereign, as the Father of their mutual country; here true patriotism and loyalty are the same; or at least their unison prevents discrimination. Every man of reflection and understanding, must feel deeply interested in the fate of his country; because its constitution en-ables him to consider himself a member of the community, a participator in the be-nefits of the social compact Ð he finds by it, and the purity of the laws, that his person and property are protected Ð it is nothing therefore in such a situation for</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="268">
        <p>a man to risk his life to maintain the in-dependence of his country; because that in losing it, he would lose what was of more value to him, and his posterity than life itself. 
What solid prospect, therefore, can an invader have of success, in attacking a nation consisting of twelve millions, and whose spirit will urge them to call forth every resource, in defence of a Sove-reign they love, and a constitution that ensures their liberty. 
But if the visible means of de-fence possessed by this great nation, ap-pear adequate to the object; they must much exceed, when to these are added the Protection of God, who ever favors a righteous cause. And if, at the intercession of the benevolent patriarch, He said that Sodom should not be destroyed, if ten upright persons were found therein Ð How many tens of</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="269">
        <p>hundreds are there throughout the British Isle, that make God their hope. Then may he for their sake, inspire the Coun-cils of the Nation with wisdom, and pour an undaunted courage into the hearts of the warriors that defend her, that they may determine to obtain victory, or the bed of honor; and that the cunning of their enemy may be turned to folly. 
On viewing the cultivated state of the country, the great population, the advanced state of the arts, the riches and the luxury the regularity of military and political arrange-ments, the subordination and distinction of rank, the industry displayed in the one &amp; the eminent abilities in the other; and com-paring it with the feeble attempt at agriculture, the scanty population, the absence of arts, the poverty and rough fare, the want of regularity or system in public transactions, the ignorance of subordination or distinction of ranks, except voluntary or nominal, the almost total</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="270">
        <p>disuse of industry; and the contracted scale on which abilities are exerted amongst our American tribes, we are struck with admiration at the contrast; and from a superficial observation of this great diversity of characters, manners, and customs, might be led to almost imagine the species different, and judging of the men by their productions, the natives of America would fall to a very low grade. 
But when to judge of men, we pene-trate their minds, and learn in history, that the same nation might have bore a very dif-ferent character at one period of time to that which it bears at another, we are inclined with more justice to attribute their variety of talents, manners and customs, virtues and vices, to the diversity of occu-pations, of education, and of local situa-tions, by the means of which the faculties of the mind may be improved, the passions restrained by reason or let loose without controul; in some climates some of these may have such force, as to be almost ir-restrainable, in others reason easily takes the command.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="271">
        <p>In the earliest ages of Europe the employ-ments of the herdsman and hunter were blended together, and those, who were less partial to, or less fortunate in the chace, had in their flocks, a more certain source of support, and where-with to excite their care. The being successful in the increase of these gave rise to distinc-tion of property Ð and numerous herds were a certain support to an increasing offspring, hunting may therefore in such circumstances be considered rather as an amusement than a source of sustenance. 
The care requisite to provide provender for the maintenance of cattle, and to protect them from ferocious beasts, or from the in-clemencies of the climate exercise the facul-ties of the mind in looking forward to pre-pare for future exigencies, and perhaps, the first type of a commissary, was the keeper of a drove of cattle. Local situa-tions impeding emigration have caused the wandering herdsman to become sedentary. Thus living in plenty he had leisure to im-prove gradually in agriculture, building,</p>
      </div>
      <div type="page" n="272">
        <p>apparel, food, the useful arts, and latterly in commerce, luxury and science; the first in-ventions are generally imperfect; but they are in time brought to maturity and perfection. 
But what has protected and thereby enabled the arts to rise to eminence, they are found in Europe, is equita-ble and just laws, which secure to every man the produce of his skill or of his in-dustry Ð These have generally been entered into by mutual compact, and have either been formed by the legislators of each nation or taken from ancient codes; and adapted to remedy general occurrences of wrong. Conquest or mutual need of support has caused to be united under one head and as one nation, what formerly composed different independent communities. Thus from great power, originate great exertions, and these bring to light great talents, adequate to the command of armies of one hundred thousand men, or capable to direct the force of a mighty Empire: yet the field is diminished for the display of talents, by reducing the number of the actors.</p>

      <div type="page" n="273">
        <p>In America perhaps one cause of its scanty population, may be that it has been peopled at a later period than the other Hemisphere; but be this as it may, it is evident that the local situation, and ne-cessary occupations of the inhabitants is the most apparent cause, why the use-ful arts had made so little progress there, when first discovered by the Europeans. 
Destitute of domesticated ani-mals of any account, from which to derive support or assistence in the cultivation of the ground Ð the agriculture practised was rude, of small extent, and among the northern tribes, chiefly left to the women; in the forests the men sought, as they yet seek the animals of the chace, there-with to supply their families with flesh and using the skins for clothing. This is an employment the uncertainty of which leaves not much room either for regu-lar management or foresight Ð the re-</p>

        <p>quisite qualification for a hunter is activity to be keen eyed, and to possess a presence of mind, so as not to lose opportunities, when they present themselves; but with all these qualifications he is yet much dependent upon chance Ð When the hunting is over, and he returns to his village or settlement, there is nothing to call particularly for his care or manage-ment, he seeks therefore for amusements to pass away his time, until he is again compelled by his wants to seek his prey in the forest or incited to go to war in sup-port of the honor of his tribe or for the des-truction of its enemies. 
Thus his whole life is passed in the two extremes of extraordinary activity, or idleness, without any object to call forth his talents except, war, hunting or the little policy of his tribe, the arts uncon-nected with these he considers as un-worthy his notice. The European is from the circumstances of his situation perseveringly industrious, his calculations far extended into futurity, judging of the</p>

        <p>future by the past, he makes and sometimes executes extensive plans, for notwithstanding his great wisdom, it sometimes pleases the Great Spirit to baffle, and frustrate his projects by unforeseen accidents. It is however with gentlemen or independent men of business, who are capable of applying their minds to great concerns, that talents are most conspicuous, the laborer or journeyman who depends on his earning for a sustenance goes on the beaten track of labor, without finding any thing to exercise his mind; unless he has been so fortunate as to have had a religious education to learn him to correct the natural corruption of the human heart, and to pass that day, set apart by God, according to his com-mandments. 
But the American is it may almost be said necessarily idle, and un-steady; althoÕ active and persevering in hunting or in war, sharp sighted and dextrous in taking advantages either of the game, or of his enemy, eloquent in Council;</p>
